Each study is completed over the period of 2-6 weeks. Coached by an instructor, students utilize any content they wish, including Open Educational Resources, to learn material in an authentic learning environment (Herrington &#x26; Oliver, 2000).

This suggests the high financial cost of serving students in smaller niche classes, which can be reduced through the use of micro-labs courses as one teacher can coach significantly more student-led learning teams and less building resources are needed. Self-adaptive learning benefits students as they are able to learn the material in the manner, and with the resources of their choice. Students are also able to learn from and contribute to a community of practice in which they may later be employed. In addition, micro-labs courses better prepare students for today's highly competitive and rapidly changing workplace, as they develop experience in directing their own learning.</p>\\n<h3>Micro-labs as a Class</h3>\\n<p>A normal class defines both the required learning outcomes and the required inputs (the homework, projects, group assignments etc.) that students must experience in order to (hopefully) arrive at the required outcomes.

In a similar way, the micro-lab course provides an architecture for students to build learning communities and use learning objects of their choosing.</p>\\n<p>Another model that's helpful in understanding micro-lab classes is supply-push vs. demand-pull. Supply-push describes the traditional curriculum model, where faculty plan their courses to push knowledge to students through means such as textbooks or lectures. Demand-pull describes the type of learning typically done by extracurricular learners. For example, a person desiring more knowledge (demand) about RFID tags might search the Internet and pull information from various web pages.</p>\\n<p>A micro-lab class is a demand-pull not supply-push type class. Students decide what they want to learn and pull in content as needed and ask questions to different learning communities as needed. Supply-push models work best when resources are scarce, such as when professors are the sole source of information. Demand-pull models seem best when resources are abundant. Today's Internet provides a tidal wave of information that learners can access.</p>\\n<p>Brown and Adler state:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The demand-pull approach is based on providing students with access to rich (sometimes virtual) learning communities built around a practice. It is passion-based learning, motivated by the student either wanting to become a member of a particular community of practice or just wanting to learn about, make, or perform something. Often the learning that transpires is informal rather than formally conducted in a structured setting. Learning occurs in part through a form of reflective practicum, but in this case the reflection comes from being embedded in a community of practice that may be supported by both a physical and a virtual presence and by collaboration between newcomers and professional practitioners/scholars.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In my next post, I'll describe a micro-lab class we ran at BYU.</p>\\n\",\n\t\t\t\t\"frontmatter\": {\n\t\t\t\t\t\"readNext\": null,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"title\": \"Organizing University Learning: Moving Beyond the Course to Micro-labs\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"tags\": [\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Education\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Learning\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"social networking\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"social learning\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"micro-labs\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"universities\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"course design\"\n\t\t\t\t\t],\n\t\t\t\t\t\"date\": \"October 21, 2009\"\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"pathContext\": {\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/organizing-university-learning-moving-beyond-classroom/\",\n\t\t\t\"component\": \"/Users/kylemathews/programs/blog/pages/blog-post.js\"\n\t\t}\n\t};\n\n/***/ }\n\n});\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** 5.path---organizing-university-learning-moving-beyond-classroom-e58e753747c71156fa31.js\n **/","module.exports = {\n\t\"data\": {\n\t\t\"config\": {\n\t\t\t\"siteMetadata\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"title\": \"Bricolage\",\n\t\t\t\t\"author\": \"Kyle Mathews\"\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"markdown\": {\n\t\t\t\"id\": \"/Users/kylemathews/programs/blog/pages/2009-10-21---organizing-university-learning-moving-beyond-classroom/index.md\",\n\t\t\t\"bodyHTML\": \"<p>University learning is centered on the course.
