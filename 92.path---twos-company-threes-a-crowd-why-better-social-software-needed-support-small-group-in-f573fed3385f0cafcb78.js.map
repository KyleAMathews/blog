One article I read recently by Clay entitled, \\\"<a href=\\\"http://shirky.com/writings/community_scale.html\\\">Communities, Audiences, and Scale</a>\\\"is especially good and provided much of the inspiration for this post.

Audiences primarily consume content, communities primarily communicate with one another. TVs have audiences -- they have large numbers of people that watch their content. But there is very little communication between individual watchers of TV and between the watchers and the makers of TV content. On the other hand, a small group of men who gather to play cards on Friday nights is a community -- because they actively communicate with one another. Communities communicate with one another, audiences don't.</p>\\n<p>In addition, a group is a group and a community is a community because of the connections that form between its members. Two best friends have very strong connections. A high school basketball team has connections from running lines and sitting on the bus together for long road trips.</p>\\n<p>But connections get weaker and weaker as a group or community adds more members. Connections are created by communication. With two people, all communications happens between the two people. So the connections made are very strong. Add another person and the number of connections that need to be maintained increases from 1 to 3. Add another person making 4 in the group and the number of connections increases from 3 to 6. Add another member and the connections become 10 (<a href=\\\"http://shirky.com/writings/community_scale.html#2\\\">read Clay for more of the math</a>).

It's possible to have 2-3 best friends but no more. The \\\"gang\\\" you hung out with in high school probably had 4-7 people but no more. Older people tend to have fewer friends then younger adults but with closer bonds. Clay Shirky references the research of primatologist Robin Dunbar who argues that, \\\"humans are adapted for social group sizes of around 150 or less, a size that shows up in a number of traditional societies, as well as in present day groups such as the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutterite\\\">Hutterite religious communities</a>.\\\"</p>\\n<p>This contradicts a fundamental assumption of most designers of social software that \\\"more users is always a good thing.\\\" Different types of groups can maintain their identity to different sizes but at some scale all online communities start to lose the dense interconnections that make the community a community.</p>\\n<p>The line where an audience begins and a community ends can get rather murky with online social software.
