The author, Scott McLemee, wrote about what he’s learned from a pamphlet by C. Wright Mill “On Intellectual Craftsmanship”. Here’s the key quote,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>What Mills calls “intellectual craftsmanship” involves more than the ability to produce work that can pass peer review. “Scholarship is a choice of how to live,” he writes, “as well as a choice of career.” It is (if I may be excused for borrowing another <a href=\\\"http://www.hnn.us/blogs/entries/18349.html\\\">old Greek word</a>) an <em>ethos.</em> That is, a structure of habits that sustains and embodies a quality of mind, a tendency of character.</p>\\n<p>“Whether he knows it or not,” Mills goes on to say, “the intellectual workman forms his own self as he works towards the perfection of his craft.” The notion of having a “career” is subordinate to — even a side-effect of — this process of inner shaping. “To realize his own potentialities, and any opportunities that come his way,” the scholar “constructs a character which has its core the qualities of the good workman.”</p>\\n<p>For Mills, there is a kind of bench where all of this crafting takes place. He calls it “the file.” I’m not sure this is the happiest of expressions. It’s simple enough, but Mills uses it in his own sense.&quot;</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Mills suggests that aspiring young intellectuals keep what he calls, “the file,” or the term I like, “intellectual journal.” Here are collected reading notes, stray ideas, and complications or successes in research. It serves as a journal as you analyze and sort through ideas. Mill writes that the process of collecting and sifting through your notes and ideas leads to more systematic thinking as well as more directed and thorough learning.</p>\\n<p>Starting my junior and senior years of high school, I came to love writing. Not that it is entertaining or easy – it’s about the hardest thing to do intellectually – but for the powerful and beneficial effect it has on my thinking. I find that when I write about an idea I’ve had or a book I’ve read, the writing serves to clarify my thinking and make explicit my reasoning.</p>\\n<p>My experience with the effects of writing fits with Mill’s main assertion, that the keeping of the file or intellectual journal is critical to the “[construction of] a character which has its core the qualities of the good workman.” My writing refined and shaped my intellectual charecter.</p>\\n<p>A critical realization I’ve come to over the past several years is the importance of my habits. My life is directed more by what I choose to do every day then any so-called life changing decisions. I like to think of habits as bricks. A single brick is really quite insignificant but from thousands of bricks mortared together come sturdy houses and soaring cathedrals. And from habits we build, one brick at a time, our lives. My life, whether it will be useful and great or broken and poor, depends a great deal on my habits.</p>\\n<p>The great disconnect in most people’s lives is between what they know they should do and what they actually do. Witness the vast number of people enslaved by addictions: alcohol, drugs, gambling, food, and so forth. What they lack is internal discipline or the character to live what they know is right. For whatever reason they have never built the character that allows their mind to rule their body. Instead, their bodies enslave their minds.</p>\\n<p>So how does this bring us back to Mill’s file? For many years, there has been a disconnect between what I want to be intellectually, and what I actually do, my habits. I feel far too often I don’t think as I should. I don’t analysis, probe, collect, sift, sort, synthesize. In other words, as much as I want to, I don’t have the character of an intellectual workman.</p>\\n<p>My hope is this blog will provide the motivation and discipline to write so as to help me develop the habits of the mind of an intellectual craftsman.</p>\\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Other people seem to be thinking along the same lines: <a href=\\\"http://savageminds.org/2006/08/14/c-wright-mills-on-blogging/\\\">here</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/about\\\">here</a>.

I don’t intend to review the book per se (but here are two good reviews, <a href=\\\"http://www.chicagoboyz.net/archives/004376.html\\\">1</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/06/19/bohea19.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2005/06/19/botop.html\\\">2</a>) but instead comment on some interesting points the author made.</p>\\n<p>First was the level of economic sophistication the Romans reached. Archaeologists evacuating Roman-era sites are consistently overwhelmed by the vast quantity and quality of the pottery they find. Not only is the quantity impressive but there is strong evidence for the existence of large ‘industrial’ producers of pottery that dominating the trade. Pottery from one large producer of tableware in southern France active around 100 A.D. has been found throughout the western Roman empire, past the Hadrian wall into Scotland, and as far east as present-day Moscow.</p>\\n<p>On another site on the left bank of the Tiber in Rome, there stands a hill some 150 feet high. It is made up entirely of broken oil amphorae from southern Spain. It is estimated that the hill has the remains of some 53 million amphorae, in which around six billion liters (1.56 billion gallons or around 2500 Olympic-sized swimming pools) of oil were transported. Obviously, the Romans could move impressive quantities over long distances!</p>\\n<p>With the beginning of the barbarian invasions, the economic complexity ended. The confusion broke continent-wide trade routes and millions were thrust into the dark ages. The author contrasts the remains of two sites, one a tiny farmstead on a difficult upland spot in Italy occupied from 200 BC to 100 A.D., and the other a sixth and seventh-century rural palace of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Northumbria. On the Roman farmstead, evacuation produced an impressive range of pottery vessels: huge storage jars, kitchen wares, some locally produced others imported from the West coast of Italy, amphorae from the same area, and finally, glossy tablewares imported from another pottery in Italy near Naples. Contrast this with the pottery found in post-Roman England as the author, Ward-Perkins describes it, “The vessels were hand-shaped, out of poorly processed clay, and were only lightly fired (so they are very friable).”</p>\\n<p>It’s shocking in a way to see how fragile economies are. Within the span of the lifetime of a Roman born around 400 A.D. much of the prosperity, peace, and security they enjoyed at birth was lost and stayed at pre-Roman levels for nearly 1000 years. Skills as mundane as creating fine pottery or stone buildings were lost in Britain for hundreds of years. The majority of people alive have never seen a real dip in prosperity. In American since the end of WW2, we have seen extremely steady upward growth, the most incredible period of economic growth in history. Virtually everyone alive is richer materially then there parents were and whose parents were richer then there parents were and expects there children to become even richer still.</p>\\n<p>Though the US has the strongest, most diverse, most steady economy in the world, one wanders all the same if it could fall. It was by no means inevitable that we’ve reached this point. Nor is it a sure thing that we will continue to enjoy our present prosperity.</p>\\n<p>I don’t know what the future will bring but I do know I enjoyed my book. It made me think.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 416 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Ubuntu 6.10—Edgy Eft—thoughts on upgrading from Dapper\",\"tags\":[\"Linux\",\"Ubuntu\"],\"date\":\"2006-11-11T03:42:01.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Updated my dapper installation on my laptop to Edgy a while ago.

A math analogy, if you add 1 to 1 that is a 100% improvement. If you add 1 to 2 that is a 50% improvement. If you continue that on upward, adding 1 to 100 is only a 1% improvement. Linux is still making good progress just it is not as obvious now due to the substantial work already completed.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 417 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"A Good Test\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"Learning\"],\"date\":\"2006-12-31T06:37:26.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I recently finished up a semester at <a href=\\\"http://www.byu.edu\\\" title=\\\"BYU\\\">BYU</a>. The end of another semester brings with it that joyful tradition, finals. Going through six finals gave me cause to think quite a bit about tests; what are they for and why are they useful?</p>\\n<p>I came up with three ways to measure the quality of a test:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Does it measure something valuable?</li>\\n<li>Is the test both reliable and valid?</li>\\n<li>Does it provide the correct incentives?</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>Does it measure something valuable?</strong><br>\\nThis depends on the context of the test – a juggling test is valuable for a circus school, a gum chewing test is valuable to aspiring gum gurus, etc. The important questions is, does the test measure one’s understanding of or skill in the valuable part(s) of a subject matter.</p>\\n<p><strong>Is the test both reliable and valid?</strong><br>\\nReliable means the test is consistently administered and graded for all test takers. Valid means the test measures what it intends to. A juggling test which asks a student to hold two balls but not throw them would be a reliable test – all test takers could be measured easily the same – but wouldn’t be valid as being able to hold two balls doesn’t show that one can in fact juggle balls. A professor can prepare a test that measures all students fairly but wouldn’t test the students on anything valuable (as defined above).</p>\\n<p><strong>Does it provide the correct incentives?</strong><br>\\nI haven’t worked this measure out satisfactorily in my mind yet but it’s something like the following. People’s behavior is shaped by incentives. Because tests are a major part of a class grade and most students care about grades, tests motivate students to study more then they would without the incentive. So far this is fine and dandy. I for one appreciate tests for this very reason as I know I’ve studied more, and learned more, over the years because of tests.</p>\\n<p><strong>So why can this go wrong?</strong><br>\\nStudents go to school to learn, presumably. There is of course the old yarn that education is the only thing that Americans pay for and hope to be cheated. Many students it seems care more about the grade then for learning. Because learning is hard, there is a strong incentive for students to try to ‘game’ the test. Some types of tests can be passed by cramming the night before the tests. Tests that only require you to memorize material don’t promote true learning. So this poorer sort of test would provide the wrong incentive to students in that it pushes them toward the poorer sort of learning. A good test would push students toward the richer, and harder, sort of learning.</p>\\n<p>Now what types of tests provide the correct or wrong incentives I’m not quite sure. As I said, I haven’t completely worked this measure out. I’m not even sure if it is a correct measure. If at some point I can work up more interest in this topic to clarify my thinking, I’ll write another post. Or someone else can save me the work and write it themselves (or link to a page in the comments section).</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 418 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Take Risks to Open Options\",\"tags\":[\"entrepreneurship\",\"Learning\"],\"date\":\"2007-02-15T06:20:32.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I was reading a <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2007/02/entrepreneur_hi.html\\\">blog post</a> earlier by <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/blog/\\\">Ross Mayfield.</a> He was asked what were his <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2007/02/entrepreneur_hi.html\\\">best decision and worst mistake as an entrepreneur.</a></p>\\n<p>All his answers were good but I was especially struck by what he calls his biggest mistake:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Biggest Mistake – Not taking bigger risks earlier</strong></p>\\n<p>Maybe because in hindsight all risks are clear, but I always find myself regretting not taking bigger risks earlier.

Partially because we thought there would be cannibalization, partially because we were understaffed to really engage with the community. But I believe if we bought this bullet earlier in the history of the company we would be reaping better rewards. As a planning exercise, now I always try to ask two questions: “How could we take more risk?” and “What risk can we take that creates the greatest amount of options?” I find there is always a way to do a little more, in particular by getting past instinct to control prevalent in so many entrepreneurs.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I was so struck because I’m in the middle of taking a big risk.</p>\\n<p>I am passionate about web development.

The stories we tell others, the stories we tell ourselves, and the stories we find in books and on TV. There is a great power in stories. Stories change how we think and view the world. Marketers know this – every advertisement is a story. A particularly famous example of this is <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Fogle\\\" title=\\\"Jared the Subway Guy\\\">Jared the Subway guy</a>. His story of how he lost weight from eating subways powerfully sells the idea that Subway’s food is healthy.</p>\\n<p>Earlier I was looking at the website for the <a href=\\\"http://www.python.org/\\\" title=\\\"Python\\\">Python programming language</a>. One might think a website devoted to a programming language, a technical and geeky subject, wouldn’t have any stories. But no, programming languages have stories too apparently, there are some 33 “<a href=\\\"http://www.python.org/about/success\\\">success stories</a>” written by users of Python.</p>\\n<p>Oftentimes, while reading or listening, we only remember the stories the speech or book. Jesus Christ was a master at teaching with stories, or parables (a story with a moral) as they are called in the Bible. In his seminal book, “<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_the_Christ_(book_by_James_E._Talmage)\\\" title=\\\"Jesus the Christ -- from Wikipedia\\\">Jesus the Christ</a>”, <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._Talmage\\\" title=\\\"James Talmage\\\">James Talmage</a> wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>[A] simple story will live, even in minds which for the time being are incapable of comprehending any meaning beyond that of the commonplace story itself. Many a peasant who heard the little incident of the sower and the four kinds of soil, of the tares sown by an enemy at night, of the seed that grew through the planter had temporarily forgotten it, would be reminded by the recurring circumstances of his daily work. . . and then, when time and experience, including suffering perhaps, had prepared them for deeper thought, they would find the living kernel of gospel truth within the husk of the simple tale.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>As social animals, we love to tell stories. We turn every event in our life into a story. A friend meeting another friend, the first word of of their mouths is, “I’ve got to tell you what happened last night”. We have this strong impulse inside us to turn our lives into a story.</p>\\n<p>This blog post started to form when I was thinking about journal writing. I was trying to understand what compels me to write in my journal and why is the experience of writing so powerful. While thinking, I had the insight that it’s because of stories.</p>\\n<p>When I write in my journal I find my story and myself. I weave the threads of my life, past, present, and future, into a coherent story. I create a plot line, a protagonist (me hopefully), antagonists, and an destiny. I decide why what happened, happened, I decide what needs to happen and if my story is in need of a plot or character shift.</p>\\n<p>“Know yourself”, the Philosopher shouts. I write to know myself. I write as a historian, to know my past. I write as a journalist, to know my present. And I must write as a prophet, write my most powerful stories, to know my future.</p>\\n<p>What if my life doesn’t have a story? Then my life is meaningless, without root or branch. I am not stable but pushed about by every fad or fashion. So in short, writing a journal helps me discover my story.

Enterprise 2.0 tools promise to provide more flexible and efficient collaboration within organizations.</p>\\n<p>Andrew McAfee, professor at Harvard Business School <a href=\\\"http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/enterprise_20_version_20/\\\">defines Enterprise 2.0</a> as follows</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Enterprise 2.0 is the use of emergent social software platforms within companies, or between companies and their partners or customers.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>‘Freeform’ in this case means that the software is most or all of the following:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Optional</li>\\n<li>Free of up-front workflow</li>\\n<li>Egalitarian, or indifferent to formal organizational identities</li>\\n<li>Accepting of many types of data</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Or as put more simply by <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/\\\">Ross Mayfield of Socialtext</a>: “<a href=\\\"http://many.corante.com/archives/2005/05/25/fear_greed_and_social_software.php\\\">Social Software adapts to its environment</a>, instead of requiring its environment to adapt to software”</p>\\n<p>What this means is social software is not a one-size fits all type of software. It does not try to rigidly fit a company and its processes into the preconceived notions of the software’s creators.</p>\\n<p>Corporations for years have tried to install industrial-strength collaboration tools <a href=\\\"http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6087566.html\\\">but employees don’t use them</a>. This is the natural result of software attempting to impose processes. People don’t like to change behavior to fit software.</p>\\n<p>Better are collaboration tools that allow emergence. “<a href=\\\"http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/enterprise_20_version_20/\\\">Emergent means that the software is freeform</a>, and that it contains mechanisms to let the patterns and structure inherent in people’s interactions become visible over time.” Or in other words, emergent software merely discovers the way employees think and act in particular environment. Only then are business processed defined. The practice defines the process.(find link) This means employees are much more likely to actually use the tools IT rolls out as they can use the tools in a way that feels natural.</p>\\n<p>A college in California applied the principle of emergence to the construction of new sidewalks between buildings. Instead of building the sidewalks right away, they let students walk on the new grass for a semester. At the end of the semester, it was evident by the tramped grass where most students wanted to walk. So the sidewalks were built where the grass was tramped.</p>\\n<p>Software based collaboration tools let people collaborate anywhere and at anytime. Collaboration on ideas isn’t restricted to one meeting room or one office. People can collaborate between meetings, after hours, or anytime an idea occurs to them.</p>\\n<p>Software collaboration tools make finding help easier. When searching for an answer, it is better to ask as many people as possible because you don’t know in advance who has the answer, a technique called “<a href=\\\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5544.html\\\">broadcast search</a>”. Collaboration tools such as wikis or blogs let you ask everyone in the organization. <a href=\\\"http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/comments/tear_down_these_walls/\\\">The British Parliament in the 18th century offered the equivalent of about $12 million</a> to anyone who could devise a method to ‘find longitude.’ “The prize was eventually won, not by a famed astronomer or scientist of the day, but by the self-taught Yorkshire clockmaker John Harrison.” Another example, <a href=\\\"http://www.socialtext.com/node/113\\\">a sales manager at the commercial wiki company Socialtext</a> was asked by a prospective customer for a comparison between forums and wikis. Not knowing much about the topic, he created a wiki page on the companies wiki and broadcast throughout the company that he needed help. “Within four hours, five team members, including engineers, had contributed to the wiki page with numerous revisions. I had basically a final version that I simply exported as a Word doc, tweaked with final formatting, and emailed to the customer.” He reflects that he could of asked one or two people in marketing for help but the result wouldn’t of been nearly as good as the result from the wiki.</p>\\n<p>Software collaboration software creates a “group memory”. All content created with collaboration tools is achieved and easily searchable. No more will valuable ideas and plans be lost in an email inbox or the Intranet. This creates a quick ramp-up time for new employees and provides a convenient record of all past projects discussions.</p>\\n<p>Results from early adapters of “Enterprise 2.0” tools are starting to return. Business Week reported in November of 2005 that “research firm Garner Group predicts that wikis will become mainstream collaboration tools in at least 50% of companies by 2009…At DrKW, [CIO JP] Rangaswami says that among the earliest and most aggressive adopters, e-mail volume on related projects is down 75%; meeting times have been whacked in half.”</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.socialtext.com/customers/case-studies/drkw\\\">In an extensive case study written about wiki adoption at DrKW</a>, reporting on meetings they wrote, “The teleconference used to be one and a half hours long [before the wiki], with much time wasted on bringing people up to speed on the week’s events. Now team members update themselves on the wiki, and that part of the teleconference takes five to ten minutes.”</p>\\n<p>Employees of DrKW also find the wiki useful to plan presentations. They report that now with a wiki, “one person co-ordinated [planning the presentation], setting up an agenda page and individual pages for each of the main slides so that everyone - asynchronously, in their own time and in parallel - could write the presentation. Within about three of four hours, a presentation evolved that would have taken days and been a much more frustrating process had it been through email and PowerPoint attachments.”</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://billives.typepad.com/portals_and_km/2006/06/making_wikis_wo.html\\\">Employees at Novell also find that wikis ease collaboration</a>. When someone finds an article on a discussion within the company, they link the article as a comment to a wiki page on the topic. This is accessible to enterprise search and those who are “tracking” this page are notified immediately of the addition to the wiki page. When someone finds the page, they have all the context available to understand the complete discussion. Novell finds wikis reduce redundancy in research and dialog and makes collaboration much more efficient.</p>\\n<p>Both DrKW and Novell and many others find that the tools of “Enterprise 2.0” make collaboration more flexible and efficient. Below is a closer look at the software that makes up “Enterprise 2.0”:</p>\\n<h2>Internal Blogs</h2>\\n<p>Most now are familiar with blogs. These easy-to-use communication device are widely used on the Internet by from everyone from politicians, to family groups, to newspapers. As of 14 March 2007, Technorati, an online blog search engine, <a href=\\\"http://technorati.com/about/\\\">is tracking 71.2 million blogs</a>.

It is ideal to run projects and to work with heterogeneous teams. It is also useful to promote dialogue and find lateral ideas outside the team.</li>\\n<li>It allows integrating conversations with a shared vision. It is an excellent means for the leaders to communicate.</li>\\n<li>It is the space where interpretations and different points of view come up so that the any member of the organization can discuss and debate them.</li>\\n<li>It is an excellent means for the employees to achieve an integrated vision of the company by joining in conversations.</li>\\n<li>It implies an open communication platform that allows new ways relating and coordinating actions among the organizational members and between the latter and the network of external relationships.</li>\\n<li>It becomes the written memory of the organization. Furthermore, writing conveys emotional stability which eventually promotes the process of organizational development.</li>\\n<li>They speed up the transference and transformation of knowledge to make ideas flow easily and take learning into action.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Enterprise quality blogging software includes:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.drupal.org\\\">Drupal</a> (open source)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.userland.com/\\\">Manila</a> (paid)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.21publish.com/\\\">21Publish</a> (paid)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.typepad.com/\\\">Typepad</a> (paid)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/\\\">Moveable Type</a> (paid)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.knownow.com/\\\">KnowHow</a> (paid/open source) – enterprise version of WordPress</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Wikis</h2>\\n<p>The most famous example of the wiki is Wikipedia. <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki\\\">Wikipedia defines a wiki as</a> “a website that allows the visitors themselves to easily add, remove, and otherwise edit and change available content, typically without the need for registration.

One article I read recently by Clay entitled, &quot;<a href=\\\"http://shirky.com/writings/community_scale.html\\\">Communities, Audiences, and Scale</a>&quot;is especially good and provided much of the inspiration for this post. The gist of the article is that audiences scale and communities don’t. And understanding this principle I think is extra ordinarily important for designers of social software.</p>\\n<p>So what is the difference between audiences and communities? Audiences primarily consume content, communities primarily communicate with one another. TVs have audiences – they have large numbers of people that watch their content. But there is very little communication between individual watchers of TV and between the watchers and the makers of TV content. On the other hand, a small group of men who gather to play cards on Friday nights is a community – because they actively communicate with one another. Communities communicate with one another, audiences don’t.</p>\\n<p>In addition, a group is a group and a community is a community because of the connections that form between its members. Two best friends have very strong connections. A high school basketball team has connections from running lines and sitting on the bus together for long road trips.</p>\\n<p>But connections get weaker and weaker as a group or community adds more members. Connections are created by communication. With two people, all communications happens between the two people. So the connections made are very strong. Add another person and the number of connections that need to be maintained increases from 1 to 3. Add another person making 4 in the group and the number of connections increases from 3 to 6. Add another member and the connections become 10 (<a href=\\\"http://shirky.com/writings/community_scale.html#2\\\">read Clay for more of the math</a>). Obviously as the group grows larger and larger, the bonds weaken between individual members of the group.</p>\\n<p>This idea is encapsulated in several common English expressions like “two’s company, three’s a crowd”. Amongst young people, a person who tries to hang out with a couple feels like and is sometimes referred to as a “<a href=\\\"http://www.goenglish.com/ThirdWheel.asp\\\">third wheel</a>”. It’s possible to have 2-3 best friends but no more. The “gang” you hung out with in high school probably had 4-7 people but no more. Older people tend to have fewer friends then younger adults but with closer bonds. Clay Shirky references the research of primatologist Robin Dunbar who argues that, “humans are adapted for social group sizes of around 150 or less, a size that shows up in a number of traditional societies, as well as in present day groups such as the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutterite\\\">Hutterite religious communities</a>.”</p>\\n<p>This contradicts a fundamental assumption of most designers of social software that “more users is always a good thing.” Different types of groups can maintain their identity to different sizes but at some scale all online communities start to lose the dense interconnections that make the community a community.</p>\\n<p>The line where an audience begins and a community ends can get rather murky with online social software. Consider for example the weblog. If three girlfriends use blogs to discuss their lives, this is obviously a community. On the other hand, a popular blogger such as <a href=\\\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/\\\">Seth Goodin</a> is not supporting a community on its blog but is operating a broadcast media platform much as CNN or Fox News.</p>\\n<p>I’m experiencing a good example of this murkiness. <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list\\\">A Mailing list</a> is an example of social software often used to support online communities. I am a student at BYU majoring in Information Systems. The ISys department at BYU provides a mailing list for the use of the 200+ students who are in the ISys major. The mailing list is quite popular – I’d say it sees an average of 10-20 emails a day during the school year</p>\\n<p>But the funny thing I’ve observed in the year or so I’ve been on the list is that even though everyone has equal rights to email the list, I see the same 10-15 names over and over. The rest of the ISys students don’t communicate via the mailing list but rather are audience members. So it seems the mailing list, as a community-building device, can’t scale past a certain number of people.</p>\\n<p>So why does it matter if our social software isn’t so social at times, or that not everyone can/will participate on a mass mailing list? We should care because we are social creatures. In our increasingly rushed and splintered world, technology can help fulfill our need for friends and community.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/\\\">Joel Spolsky</a>, in a post entitled “<a href=\\\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BuildingCommunitieswithSo.html\\\">Building Communities with Software</a>” speaks movingly of our need as humans for community and how social software can fulfill that need. He ends his post with this message, “Creating community, in any case, is a noble goal, because it’s sorely missing for so many of us. Let’s keep plugging away at it.”</p>\\n<p>Social software done right can create a community for all its participants. I feel strongly about the need for excellent social software, in our schools, workplaces, and other organizations. Social software can help us learn, work, and live with greater effectiveness and joy.</p>\\n<p>In my next few posts I’ll continue to explore the fundamental problems and opportunities with social software.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 428 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Why I blog—Part 2\",\"tags\":[\"blogging\",\"internet-marketing\",\"Learning\",\"Writing\"],\"date\":\"2007-10-26T04:57:56.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>A year ago in just <a href=\\\"/why-i-blog-part-1/\\\">my second blog post</a>, I explained why I write a blog.

The author was commenting on a <a href=\\\"http://files.ssds.ucdavis.edu/chsc/Discover_Your_Inner_Economist.mp4\\\">recent podcast on the economics of blogging by Tyler Cowen</a> (of <a href=\\\"http://www.marginalrevolution.com/\\\">Marginal Revolution</a> fame).</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>While the direct economic return to authoring a blog may not appear to justify the effort, the prospect of actively demonstrating one’s skillset for an interested public, many members of which work in talent-hungry organisations that pay real salaries, is an attractive one. Why waste time submitting CVs, when you could cultivate an audience of potential employers intimately familiar with your talents?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Interestingly, this effect could generate a filtering effect on the blogosphere quite opposed to the market for lemon model <a href=\\\"http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/10/is-the-econ-blo.html\\\">proposed</a> by Dani Rodrik. If blog writers generally have employment in mind, we should expect those with strong resumés but lackluster ideas to abstain from extensive blogging, while those whose critical and analytical skills run ahead of the experience and education categories on their CVs should embrace blogging as a means to signal their exceptional fitness. We would expect those with most to gain from blogging to blog more.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I’ve always found school boring and homework a less then optimal use of my time. So my grades reflect that. “Good students” use grades as a signaling mechanism. A student with good grades is telling potential employers, “I’m reasonably intelligent and can tolerate boredom” – which is what’s really required at school and most jobs.</p>\\n<p>As my grades aren’t going to impress anyone, I compensate by blogging. I use this blog to “show off”, so to speak, my critical and analytic skills, my ideas, and my passion for social software, learning, and collaboration to potential employers.</p>\\n<p>But for now this is all theory–whether this works or not is still a bit up in the air. . . but in the meantime it’s better then homework. . . and since I’m done writing, back now to accounting homework I guess :&gt;</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 429 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"I really liked these insights\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"entrepreneurship\",\"innovation\",\"Learning\",\"Uncategorized\"],\"date\":\"2007-12-31T21:25:54.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>From the <a href=\\\"http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10328123\\\">Economist:</a></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>At some point in the decade after he moved from the farm in Nebraska where he grew up to the innovation hub that is the San Francisco Bay Area, Evan Williams accidentally stumbled upon three insights:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>that genuinely new ideas are, well, accidentally stumbled upon rather than sought out</li>\\n<li>second, that new ideas are by definition hard to explain to others, because words can express only what is already known</li>\\n<li>and third, that good ideas seem obvious in retrospect.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</blockquote>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 430 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"What I've been up to lately\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"elearning2.0\",\"social software\"],\"date\":\"2008-01-02T01:56:46.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I’ve gotten involved in a number of new projects in the past 6-7 months so thought I’d update y’all in what I’m doing.</p>\\n<h3>School:</h3>\\n<p>After a lovely summer break with no school and my time spent vacationing and working at a number of jobs, I came back to <a href=\\\"http://byu.edu\\\">BYU</a> for my first semester in the <a href=\\\"http://isys.byu.edu\\\">Masters of Information Systems program</a>. But, as my classes this past semester were pretty boring, I won’t mention school anymore here.</p>\\n<h3>E-commerce websites:</h3>\\n<p>I’ve built two e-commerce sites over the past six months using <a href=\\\"http://ubercart.org\\\">Ubercart</a> (a fantastic open source shopping cart – if you’re in the market for that sort of thing). Ubercart is a module (cf. plugin/extension) for <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org\\\" title=\\\"drupal\\\">Drupal</a>, an open source <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\\\">content management system</a>, another technology I’ve been working with extensively.</p>\\n<p>This past June, with two friends, I started a t-shirt company running out of our apartment. As the lone techie, I built our website at <a href=\\\"http://coolcamisa.com\\\">coolcamisa.com</a>. By our expectations, the company has been a rousing success (i.e., we didn’t lose money)! We paid back our start-up costs by September (2 1/2 months from launch) and have netted some two grand since then. Not bad for our little apartment-based bootstrapped business. I’ve learned tons about starting a business, legal stuff (we organized as an LLC), pricing, marketing, website development, etc.</p>\\n<p>My second e-commerce site I started just recently. A good friend of mine, Nicole Sheahan, released her first CD in December (She’s an excellent singer btw, <a href=\\\"http://nicolesheahan.com/product/invisible-facts\\\">so go buy her cd</a>). I’ve been helping her set up a website to sell / market her music. The site is still a work in progress but it’s amazing to me how fast it has come together. I’ve been working with open source software for awhile but I’m still impressed that I can singlehandedly put together a fully functional ecommerce store in under 10 hours for no cost other then my labor. That’s the power of a community.</p>\\n<h3>Other (Drupal) web sites:</h3>\\n<p>With a friend, I’ve been volunteering to build a website for the Utah Valley Ministerial Association. The <a href=\\\"http://utahvalleyinterfaith.org\\\">website</a> will have news and events from churches in Utah County and serve as an online directory of churches in Utah County and surrounding communities. The site is not yet fully operational but it’s soon in coming. Drupal’s “<a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/views\\\">Views</a>” module was the real workhorse here slicing and dicing the church listings for display in a number of different ways. As you can see on the website, the different “views” of the data enable a user to find churches by city, denomination, or language.</p>\\n<h4>Family History Site</h4>\\n<p>Because of my Mormon heritage, the genealogy of my ancestors is very well done. Most of my ancestoral lines are traced back to the 17-18th centuries. About two years ago, my siblings/parents and I decided that while it’s great to have names, dates, and places from our ancestors, what is really interesting is to read the stories and letters they wrote and view pictures of them and where they lived. These stories/letters/pictures/etc. flesh out the skeletal data we see on the normal family history tree.</p>\\n<p>But while current genealogical software does very well at organizing, storing, and sharing genealogical data, it does a poor job at handling other types of information. Documents and pictures tend to get lost in attics of aunts/uncles/grandparents. If you don’t have them, they’re hard to get hold of and you have them, they’re hard to share with relatives.</p>\\n<p>We decided the best solution to this problem would be to create a website. Our first answer was a <a href=\\\"http://familyhistory.mathews2000.com/\\\">wiki</a> <a href=\\\"http://bunker.mathews2000.com/\\\">website</a>. The wiki software made it easy for our widely distributed family to work together on gathering information. But after some time we grew dissatisfied with the limitations of our wiki software and decided to migrate our site to one based on Drupal. That migration is still in progress but we’re excited as Drupal will give us much more control over how information is stored and displayed (albeit with a great deal more complexity).</p>\\n<h3>A New Job</h3>\\n<p>In June, I started working as an research assistant at <a href=\\\"http://byu.edu\\\">BYU</a> in the <a href=\\\"http://ebusiness.byu.edu/\\\">Kevin &amp; Debra Rollin’s Center for eBusiness</a>.</p>\\n<p>I’m working with a professor and a pH.D student studying how web2.0 technologies can be used in the classroom to help students become more active learners.</p>\\n<p>So far I can say this is the best job I’ve ever had. What I’m doing and learning just fascinates me.</p>\\n<p>Our main research thrust this past semester was creating a community site for a class to use at BYU – <a href=\\\"http://isyscore.byu.edu/drupal\\\">http://isyscore.byu.edu/drupal</a>.</p>\\n<p>We have learned a lot from the experience – and it’s given us mountains of data to sift through – more on that in the future hopefully. Building the site showed me again the power Drupal gives a website developer (even if they really don’t know what they’re doing) to create sophisticated sites.</p>\\n<p>My other big project for my research job is creating a new module for Drupal called <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/writing_assignment\\\">writing_assignment</a>. This module will make it easy for teachers to give students writing assignments on a Drupal website. It will also facilitate easy peer-review and peer-grading of those assignments. This is my first Drupal module plus my first extensive project in PHP so I have faced quite the learning curve.

Why the power law of course.</p>\\n<p>So onto the graphs I made.</p>\\n<p>First is a graph of the number of comments each student made on the class website throughout the semester. This is a good measure of their engagement with the online community. You can see that some students left as many as 40-60 comments throughout the semester and others left as little as 1 or two:<img src=\\\"./num_comments_per_student.png\\\" alt=\\\"Number of comments made by each student\\\"></p>\\n<p>Another graph which follows the power law. This time a graph of the number of visits to the class website per student. Again we see a wide disparity between students. One student visited the site over 400 times! Which in a four month semester means they visited the site on average 3 times a day! And on the other end, a number of students only visited the site 5-10 times the entire semester.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./num_visits_to_site_per_student.png\\\" alt=\\\"Number of visits to the site made by each student\\\"></p>\\n<h3>Why the Power Law?</h3>\\n<p>So why does this happen? Why do some students participate on the class website so much more then other students? I’m not sure I know the answer to that. Why do some people write blogs, participate in Wikipedia, upload their photos to flickr, etc. and many others don’t?</p>\\n<p>Do some students just not see <a href=\\\"/why-i-blog-part-1/\\\">the value of blogging</a>? Are some students more comfortable interacting online for whatever reason? Or on another tact, does it matter if some students participate more then others? After all, in any community, there’s always a core group which cares much more then others about the success of the community (read about the <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2006/04/power_law_of_pa.html\\\">power law of participation</a>). What type of participation in an online learning community meets the learning goals for a classroom?</p>\\n<p>There’s a host of other ideas rumbling around in my head about power laws, the three types of networks (political, social, creative) and how all this relates to creating effective online learning/collaborative environments.

I and the other researchers use web analytics extensively in evaluating the effectiveness of websites we build. This post is the first in a two-part series about why and how to use web analytics for your social learning website.</p>\\n<p>This first part explains a bit about what web analytics is and why you should use it.</p>\\n<h3>Why web analytics</h3>\\n<p>All websites have a reason for existence. Depending on the site the reason could be to make money, provide leads, provide support, teach students, etc. Using web analytics helps you achieve your site’s purpose in two ways:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Using web analytics, you can measure the experience and behavior of visitors to your website. Using what is known as KPI (Key Performance Indicators) you can evaluate if your site is meeting your goals for visitors to the website–or not.</li>\\n<li>Using these KPIs you can identify areas where your site is failing to meet its goals and where it’s doing well</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>From these insights, you make decisions on what to do to improve the website. Then you evaluate the success of your changes by measuring changes in the experiences and behavior of visitors to your site, again using your KPIs (I’ll write more about KPIs in Part II).</p>\\n<p>In short, web analytics exists to power the generation of actionable insights.</p>\\n<h3>Web analytics seeks to measure three things</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Behavior?–What visitors do on the website – how often do they visit, what pages do they visit most, how long do they stay on different pages?</li>\\n<li>Outcomes–all websites have desired outcomes. The exact desired outcome varies site-to-site depending on its goals. Some sites want visitors to sign up as members. That’s one outcome. An e-commerce site’s desired outcome is a purchase. A support site’s desired outcome is for the visitor to find the answer to the question they had.</li>\\n<li>Experience–answer why the visitor did what they did.\\n<ul>\\n<li>Why did the customer add an item to his shopping cart, go through all the steps of the checkout process and then leave the site? Did they find the same item for cheaper on another site? Was the shipping price too high?</li>\\n<li>Similar questions can be asked about a social learning site. Why doesn’t one student ever visit the site? Why does another student visit twice a day. Why does a student do what they do?</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2006/05/got-surveys-recommendations-from-the-trenches.html\\\">Surveys</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2006/05/experimentation-and-testing-a-primer.html\\\">testing and experimentation</a> are some of the best ways to understand visitor’s experience.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>In my mind, the third thing is most important. It’s nice to know that a student spent an hour looking at online learning content but we’d really love to know why they did it. Did the student spend the hour because they were studying for a test? Were they finishing an assignment? Is the material helpful? What material is most helpful? Do they enjoy learning with the material?</p>\\n<p>So behavior and outcomes give you the raw data about what’s happening but experience helps you understand visitors in a more holistic manner. Understanding experience gets you into the mind of visitors to your site. Why they do what they do.</p>\\n<h3>Recap</h3>\\n<p>Web analytics help you improve your site in the following manner.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Web Analytics provides you with information to understand what visitors do on your site and why.</li>\\n<li>Using this information, you identify weakness you can correct.</li>\\n<li>You experiment with potential improvements and test your changes using your web analytic data.</li>\\n<li>Repeat starting at step 1</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Part I explained what web analytics is and why it is valuable. Part II will explain step-by-step how to use web analytics on a social learning site. I will explain the process I’m going through to implement web analytics on a new social learning website I’m building for <a href=\\\"http://byu.edu\\\">BYU</a>.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 441 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Drupal Memetracker Module — My Google Summer of Code Application\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"memetracker\",\"social software\",\"google summer of code\"],\"date\":\"2008-04-04T23:03:38.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\\n<p>I propose to write two modules for <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org\\\">Drupal</a> as part of <a href=\\\"http://code.google.com/soc/2008/\\\">Google Summer of Code</a>.

The memetracker module will use algorithms in the machinelearningapi to intelligently filter and group content from designated content sources both internal and external.

Perhaps the best way to explain the value of my module is to explain my experience with this problem and how the memetracker module will help solve this problem.</p>\\n<h3>What’s my Problem?</h3>\\n<p>For eight months now I’ve been building social learning websites for classes at <a href=\\\"http://byu.edu\\\">Brigham Young University</a> where I’m a graduate student. Working with a few professors, I build websites for their classes to be used as a learning tool by them and their students. Our goal is to understand what web2.0 tools / principles help most in education.</p>\\n<p>Any online community, like the ones I create for school, generates lots of content and conversations. As a community grows, a problem that soon emerges is how to help individual members find the content/conversations they are most interested in. If there’s only a few members in the online community, it’s easy to follow every conversation. But if there’s 100s or 1000s of members, it soon becomes impossible to follow or find every interesting conversation. This dynamic sets an upper limit on the number of members for most online communities.</p>\\n<p>In researching ways that online communities help participants find the most interesting content/conversations, I’ve found three patterns which help.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>First is the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network\\\">small-world pattern</a>. Via <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/og\\\">Organic Groups</a>, you split conversations by topic. Members congregate around only the groups they are interested in.</li>\\n<li>Second is the <a href=\\\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/nearly-a-million-users-and-no-spam-or-trolls\\\">Twitter pattern</a>. Using <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/buddylist2\\\">buddylist</a> or <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/user_relationships\\\">user_relationships</a>, members follow friends or people who’s ideas they find interesting.</li>\\n<li>The third pattern is for members to read the most interesting memes as they are somehow determined by the community (this is where my module will help out).</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Drupal sites normally implement the third pattern by having human editors manually promote the most interesting content to the front page. But I’ve found this solution to be inadequate. Human editors miss many interesting pieces of content, are prone to bias, and the solution is labor intensive. Also, promoting content to the front page doesn’t group the content by conversation or meme, an important usability improvement.</p>\\n<p>A much better solution for finding the most interesting memes are tools called memetrackers like Techmeme, Google News, Tailrank, Megite, and others. These memetrackers automatically find the most interesting content bubbling up in the blogosphere. Using these memetrackers, individual news readers can find in minutes the best content from 1000s of sources.</p>\\n<p>As the principle tech memetracker, Techmeme plays a hugely influential role in the tech community. Techmeme is the place to find conversation about the biggest tech memes of the day.</p>\\n<p>But at the moment there are only commercial memetrackers such as Techmeme. There are no free or open-source implementations and certainly nothing that can be easily plugged into Drupal.</p>\\n<p>My proposal then is to write a memetracker module that will fulfill the same role as Techmeme does to the tech community for any community for which it is installed. My module will intelligently filter and group community generated content to display to the community in real time the most interesting conversations and memes as they emerge.</p>\\n<h3>Potential users of my module can be placed in a few classes:</h3>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Those building community sites using Drupal. They face the same problem I related in my story earlier – how to help their users sift through new content and to find interesting conversations to follow and join in.</li>\\n<li>Those who want to build sites that support an existing online community. They would use <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/feedapi\\\">FeedAPI</a> to pull content from any number of relevant sources and then use memetracker to display interesting content and conversations from that community.</li>\\n<li>Users who use Memetracker as a personal news aggregator. They’d add news sources they are interested in and memetracker would learn their interests and filter and display only the news they are interested in.</li>\\n<li>Organizations who use Memetracker as an internal news gathering application pulling together content created by employees internally and outside news that’s of interest to the company.</li>\\n<li>Those who want to create a sitemap-like page for their site. Memetracker would create a page that showed all content ever created on the site and group by meme and order by popularity.</li>\\n<li>Organizations who want to create a branded news site. <a href=\\\"http://www.utahtechcouncil.org/\\\">Utah Tech Council</a> could put up a memetracker aggregating local newspapers and blogs that discuss Utah technology news. The <a href=\\\"http://www.savethedolphins.org/\\\">Save the Dolphins Foundation</a> could aggregate dolphin news from different news sources. Memetracker would help these organizations by drawing repeat visitors to view the aggregated content. It would be an advantage to Drupal as more sites would use Drupal to use the memetracking functionality.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The memetracker module will be especially useful to open source communities. Open source projects rely entirely on internet communication technologies to coordinate their efforts. Many commentators have linked the explosion of the open source to the opening of the Internet to the general population. Memetracking and aggregation sites in general are another step in the evolution of communication technologies on the internet. My memetracker module will allow any open source community, large or small, to put up a simple Drupal site and start aggregating developer blogs, forums, mailing lists, etc. into a centralized place.</p>\\n<h3>Another analogy: memetracker = smart aggregator:</h3>\\n<p>An aggregator is software like <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/planet\\\">Drupal Planet</a> or <a href=\\\"http://www.planetplanet.org/\\\">PlanetPlanet</a> that aggregates related content from many sources to display in a central location. But current aggregators are dumb. The dumb aggregator knows no better than to pull in new content and order it chronologically.</p>\\n<p>A memetracker is a smart aggregator. It also knows how to pull in new content as a dumb aggregator but it’s much smarter about how it displays the content. It can analyze the text of the content and know which authors are talking about the same topic and then group them together. But not only will the smart aggregator group similar topics but it will also learn what topics and authors are most interesting to members of the community and display those first. No more will you have to scroll through a long list of content skipping over content you’re not interested in but instead, new content will be nicely organized by meme and interestingness in a neat compact form.</p>\\n<h2>Project Details:</h2>\\n<p>To help you understand how the memetracker will work, I’ll walk through the steps the memetracker will take from first aggregating new content to finally outputting a view to the user.</p>\\n<h3>High level overview:</h3>\\n<p>The memetracker will assemble content from two sources (internal content through Drupal and external content through FeedAPI). It will then analyze the content to identify active memes. Then, using what the memetracker has learned from the click history, the memetracker will decide which memes to display and which to discard and which order to place the memes on the page (i.e. the most interesting memes will be at the top). UI code will be written to display the memes in an easy-to-browse fashion.</p>\\n<h3>Detailed Overview:</h3>\\n<p>A particular memetracker is tracking 100 sources (30 are blogs on the Drupal installation and 70 are various blogs and other news sources you are aggregating with FeedAPI). In the past two days, the 100 sources have created 300 pieces of content. The first pass through the 300 pieces of content will be to find memes. First it will check for interlinking between content – this indicates they are discussing the same meme. Second it will perform textual analysis on the titles, bodies, and tags of content to determine how “close” text is to each other (cluster analysis).</p>\\n<p>In my example, say the algorithm identifies 10 meme clusters in the 300 pieces of content. 80 of the 300 pieces of content are part of the 10 meme clusters leaving 220 individual memes, not associated with any other content.</p>\\n<p>You’ve set the memetracker to only display ~50 memes at a time as the memetracker is tracking a smaller community. This means the memetracker has to discard 250 links from the display page. It does this filtering by various means.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>The memetracker is biased toward keeping meme clusters (remember the goal is to display the most interesting content – if two people thought a meme worth writing about, odds are that meme is more interesting to the general community than a meme that only one person talked about) So the memetracker will weight meme clusters higher.</li>\\n<li>It will use a form of authority ranking for the different sources. If one blogger consistently writes interesting content that many people click on to read, then the memetracker will rank any new content by that blogger higher than new content by a less interesting blogger.</li>\\n<li>You’ll filter out topics not interesting to the community. Baysian logic is a possible way to do this. Baysian logic is often used for spam filtering. So just as spam filters learn that emails with “XXX” or “Hot chicks” probably are spam. If the community consistently clicks to read content about Drupal and not Plone, a new article about Drupal will be displayed and the Plone article won’t.</li>\\n<li>The meme tracker will use click momentum. By this I mean it’ll take a measure of how many times the content has been clicked on in the last while. If an article is being clicked on a lot, that suggests the article is more interesting to the community and should be moved up on the page.</li>\\n<li>I will implement a hook that will let other modules set simple rules to affect the filtering and ordering of memes. For example, if content from one source must always be displayed, say blog entries from the CEO (regardless of how interesting the CEO’s blog actually is), you could set a rule that content from this source will always be kept and not filtered out.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>So once the memetracker has grouped and filtered content down to the proper level. It’ll pass data to the UI code to be rendered and pushed out to the browser.</p>\\n<h3>Viewing Memes:</h3>\\n<p>There will be two ways (initially) to view memes. First via meme browsing pages that admins define or via custom views of data exposed by memetracker.</p>\\n<p>Admins will be able to define meme browsing pages in a process similar to creating a new panel page. When creating a new meme browsing page, you will define the page url, what sources to include (different Drupal content types, external sources from FeedAPI), and a number of settings for the page such as how long to keep old memes before refreshing and the number of memes to display at a time.</p>\\n<p>Individual meme browsing pages will look similar to Techmeme with main articles, discussion, and related content:</p>\\n<p>Screenshot from <a href=\\\"http://techmeme.com\\\">Techmeme</a> – My memetracker UI will look similar.<a href=\\\"http://techmeme.com\\\"></a><a href=\\\"http://techmeme.com\\\">2</a></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./techmeme.png\\\" alt=\\\"techmeme example\\\"></p>\\n<h3>How is memetracker different from other content recommendation engines on Drupal?</h3>\\n<p>There is some overlap in functionality but a large difference is in purpose. <a href=\\\"http://http//www.civicactions.com/blog/similar_content_module_wrapup\\\">Other content recommendation engines for Drupal</a> recommend similar or related content in the context of a single node. Memetracker also recommends content but en masse. It focuses on conversations – what are people saying now about all the current hot topics. Not what did someone say about the topic of the current node six months or two years ago.</p>\\n<h3>How will the memetracker learn to filter and group memes?</h3>\\n<p>The SoC application template asks what aspects of my proposal depend on further research or experiments. The machine learning portion of my proposal, much more than any other part fits this criteria. Machine learning is actively researched and many algorithms are now well understood. However, deciding on the correct algorithms that will fit the constraints of a web application (fast response times, low resource usage) will take considerable research and experimentation. But while the specifics are still unknown, the general direction I’ll take is clear.</p>\\n<p>The general machine learning technique I’ll use is called <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning\\\">reinforcement learning</a>. Reinforcement learning is that the algorithm learns by making a guess and then gets feedback. If the guess is good, that “state” of the algorithm is reinforced, if the guess is bad, that “state” is weakened. The algorithm gradually learns what states are most appropriate to a given situation. So in the case of the memetracker, it will guess what memes are interesting to the community and what order to place the memes on the page. Then based on feedback from the community (i.e. if links are clicked on or not clicked on) the memetracker will learn gradually how to select and display the most interesting content.</p>\\n<p>There are two major machine learning problems to be solved. Filtering out uninteresting content and clustering or grouping content into memes.</p>\\n<p>When filtering, the machine learning algorithm basically has to answer the question, will this piece of content on this topic written by this author be of sufficient interest to the general community to include on the Meme Browsing page? There are a number of algorithms that I’ve looked at to answer this question including <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier\\\">naïve bayes</a>, <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation\\\">backpropegation</a>, and <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine\\\">support vector machines</a>. Each will filter adequately for the memetrackers needs, the question to answer is which will perform best.</p>\\n<p>The second machine learning problem, clustering or grouping content into memes is more straight forward to solve. I’ll use a technique called <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_clustering#Agglomerative_hierarchical_clustering\\\">agglomerative clustering</a>. This algorithm starts with each piece of content as part of its own meme. It then determines if individual memes are actually part of a larger meme. To do this you set a “closeness” threshold. If two individual memes are closer than the threshold, the two memes are joined together into a single meme. The algorithm loops through the content joining small memes into larger memes until no two memes are closer than the “closeness” threshold.</p>\\n<p>Using the above two techniques plus reinforcement learning will create a memetracking system that adapts itself to the needs of the community it supports.</p>\\n<p>In implementing these algorithms, I’ll have the support of the excellent machine learning faculty in the Computer Science department at Brigham Young University. I’ve talked to one professor extensively about my proposal and he (and most likely one of the other professors and several graduate students) is willing to mentor me as I write the machine learning code.</p>\\n<h2>Deliverables:</h2>\\n<p>These will be my deliverables at the end of the summer:</p>\\n<h3>PHP library of Machine learning algorithms:</h3>\\n<p>I will write the machine learning algorithms as a PHP library. The library won’t be coupled to Drupal so will be portable to other open source PHP projects.</p>\\n<h3>Machine_learningAPI module:</h3>\\n<p>This module will provide a wrapper for the machine learning algorithm library.</p>\\n<h3>Memetracker module:</h3>\\n<p>This module will have several major components:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Meme browsing UI – this will be the primary view for browsing memes. It will be refreshed each cron run with new content.</li>\\n<li>Panels-like meme browsing page creator – You will be able to create any number of memebrowsing pages. When you create a new memebrowsing page, you set how long memes stay active, you set how many memes to show, and can weight the display / ranking of memes in a variety of ways.</li>\\n<li>Two hooks:\\n<ul>\\n<li>The first hook will allow other modules to modify how content is ranked. I gave an example in the project details section of how a company could modify the score of their CEO’s blog. Another potential use case is an ecommerce store might analyze content for text that mentioned their products and rank those higher.</li>\\n<li>The second hook will allow other modules to add functionality to meme browsing pages. Modules would define little ajax buttons to be added next to memes. There could be for example a send article to friend button, a save to delicious button, a bookmark button, a digg button, and other buttons that let you interact with the content.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Set of APIs</h3>\\n<p>To expose metadata about memes.</p>\\n<h3>Views integration:</h3>\\n<p>(<a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/10276#comment-33064\\\">Catch and Bill gave some suggestions on how to do this</a>)</p>\\n<h3>Documentation:</h3>\\n<p>I will write documentation for developers explaining how to use the two hooks and documentation for website operators explaining how to configure and set up a memetracker on their site.</p>\\n<h3>Tests:</h3>\\n<p>I will write a complete set of tests for the memetracker and machinelearningapi modules</p>\\n<h2>Project Schedule:</h2>\\n<p>I’m done with classes by the end of April and plan to start working on GsoC immediately. In the first 2-3 weeks of May, I will write a very rough version of the UI and machine learning code.</p>\\n<p>In the spirit of release early, release often, I will install memetracker on a public facing website. I will then put together many many memetracker pages to track different communities of bloggers and other online communities. I’ll create memetrackers for econ bloggers / liberal bloggers / conservative bloggers / edubloggers / content from the Drupal community / content on the Joomla community / Ubuntu bloggers / and many more.</p>\\n<p>My goal is to get lots of attention from these different communities so as many people start regularly using the memetrackers. Achieving high traffic is key as it will enable me to rapidly test my algorithms and iterate through 100s of variations of the machine learning algorithms. Also, building memetrackers for many types of online communities will ensure my algorithms will work well over a wide variety of content and community types.</p>\\n<p>I’ll be working mostly on improving the machine learning algorithms through the latter part of May and all of June. By the end of June I hope to have gotten the machine learning code to a very mature state.</p>\\n<p>From there I will turn my efforts to bug fixing, filling out test coverage, documentation, and improvements on the admin UI and meme browsing UI.</p>\\n<h2>Risk of failure:</h2>\\n<p>Low. Writing a working memetracker is not difficult. The devil, as they say, is in the details. Building a great memetracker is a very difficult task. I won’t have built a great memetracker by the end of the summer. Instead, my plan is to lay the foundation and build many of the necessary pieces so that with these pieces and a great deal of refining, eventually great memetrackers can be built. But I fully expect to have an adequate memetracker working at the end of the summer that will meet my needs and many others.</p>\\n<p>If writing this module does prove more difficult than I anticipated, I will limit the scope by cutting first the second hook, and then the views integration. Both of these are very nice features but not essential to creating a working memetracker.</p>\\n<h2>Biography:</h2>\\n<p>Hello Drupliers. My name is Kyle Mathews and I’m passionate about social software. I love to create software/web sites that help people connect, learn, and work together. I’m a grad student in Information Systems at Brigham Young University working as a research assistant to several faculty members. We are studying how and where social software can be used in education.</p>\\n<p>For my major, I’ve taken classes on programming, database, systems analysis, and project management. I’ve studied Java and Python at school and learned PHP while working with Drupal. I use open source full time. I’ve run Linux (Ubuntu) on my laptop full-time for the past two-years. Open source fascinates me both as a user and as a researcher of online communities and organizational behavior.</p>\\n<p>Some other experience. I wrote a web application in Java last summer for <a href=\\\"http://novell.com\\\">Novell</a>. The application queried a number of large databases and assembled and displayed information for a variety of reports used by a marketing team. I was the only developer working on the project and it took most of the summer to write working part-time.</p>\\n<p>A bit about how how I became involved with the Drupal community and the path that led me to now apply for Google Summer of Code.</p>\\n<p>I first used Drupal a year and a half ago. I debated for several months whether I liked Drupal or Joomla better before settling on Drupal. Drupal’s clean architecture was the deciding factor. I built my first production website last year using the Ubercart e-commerce module to sell t-shirts for a company some friends and I started.</p>\\n<p>My involvement and understanding in Drupal started to advance last summer when I started working as a research assistant at BYU. Since starting that job, I’ve built a number of classroom websites using Drupal (<a href=\\\"http://isyscore.byu.edu/drupal/\\\">isyscore</a>, <a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/8610\\\">web analytics site</a>, <a href=\\\"http://island.byu.edu\\\">g.d.o. like site for all Information Systems students</a>) wearing down my copy of “Pro Drupal Development” in the process. I’ve learned a considerable bit about Drupal in the past year and a half, became very involved in the community, and am writing a module (<a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/writing_assignment\\\">writing_assignment</a> – still a work in progress btw). I’ve loved most everything about Drupal but wish Drupal could do memetracking, an important component for building the perfect social learning website. This itches. So, in the best open-source fashion, I’m applying to Google Summer of Code to scratch my itch.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 442 */\n373,\n/* 443 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Assorted Links\",\"tags\":[\"blogging\",\"elearning2.0\",\"enterprise2.0\",\"innovation\"],\"date\":\"2008-04-17T18:43:26.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I think I’m going to start doing “link posts” more often.

And I’ve thought a lot about it. Why I want to learn, how I learn best, and why it seems I often don’t learn. It’s an often quoted piece of wisdom that you learn the most when you fail. In the same way, you can improve the quality of your work on something by examining what parts you do poorly and improving those. As that is where your model or methodolgy for doing whatever is breaking down.</p>\\n<p>Schooling has long been the least productive source of learning for me. College, thankfully, does much better then high school – therefore somewhat justifying the thousands of dollars they take from me each year. but still has weaknesses.</p>\\n<p>I started reading a fascinating book this morning called “The Cluetrain”[add link]. What it was about is a subject for a different blog post, however it brought up the old irritiation I have with schools. Teaching done at school has several problems. Slow methods of learning - lecture, poorly motivated students that most be spoon-fed knowledge and/or students so drunken[think of better word] by schooling system that doesn’t encourage in the slightest independent learning/thinking that they can’t learn by themselves, and/or professors that don’t teach well.</p>\\n<p>I measure learning by “ah hah” moments. Those times, when your reading or thinking about something and the pieces come together and your understanding crystalizes. These are like little shots of drugs to keep me going. It seems these moments come few and far between at school and much more often when learning by myself or with other like-minded people.</p>\\n<p>Why? I learn things faster so often bored when professor going over things I already understand. Talking very slow way of transmiting knowledge as compared to reading. biggest thing to me is perspective.</p>\\n<p>We learn things by looking at stuff from different perspectives. How often is there something you know, think you understand it very well but then talk to someone who understands it differently [think of concrete example] and all of a sudden you understand it so much better.</p>\\n<p>It’s the difference between 2D and 3D. It’s like the difference on a movie between a static shot and a sweeping panoramic shot of a say a house. It’s the difference between trying to figure the height of a house from one [what is an example that people commonly grapple with or have experienced?] shot or 20 from all different angles and distances.</p>\\n<p>If you only read liberal or conservative political commentary, how well will you truely understand issuies as compared to reading from a variety of sources?</p>\\n<p>Professors only teach from one side of an issuie most of the time whether purposely or not. It’s hard to understand. Learning about project management. Textbook/professor has authoritative this is how it is. No nuance no subtiltiy. Just from my own little expereince in world know most projects aren’t managed like that.</p>\\n<p>Being a bit unfair. What I’m learning does have some practical value. It just seems it’s undigested. I get this big ball of knowledge thrown in my lap and I have to do the hard work of unravelinging it and making connections from it. It seems to me that something well-written books and excellent teaching have in common is they help you make connections. The World Wide <em>Web</em> is an excellent way of organizing information because it mimics how our brains stores and processes information. Think about the last time you had or read a really exciting idea. It explodes in your mind. Immediately you mind races making connections, oh, that is like this, that explains better this process, we can use that to improve such-and-such that we are doing.</p>\\n<p>I like to think of our brain as an intricate web of little nuggets of knowledge with thousands of connections strewn between them forming uncountable number of connections.

For my dream to become reality, Memetracker will need help from many talented developers. This summer I’ll be setting a solid foundation for future development of the memetracker module. One important thing I’ll be doing is writing unit tests for all the functions of the memetracker. Unit tests, I’m convinced, is one thing Memetracker needs in order to ensure its long term success.</p>\\n<p>Unit tests are at the heart of <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\\\">Test Driven Development (TDD)</a>. TDD and unit tests when used have been shown to improve the quality of code and reduce bugs and regressions (see this <a href=\\\"http://www.lullabot.com/articles/introduction-unit-testing\\\">excellent post</a> by <a href=\\\"http://robshouse.net/\\\">Robert Douglass</a> for a full introduction to unit testing).</p>\\n<p>My brother <a href=\\\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminmathews\\\">Ben</a> is a software engineer and has long preached to me the benefits of unit tests and TDD. When I started programming Memetracker, I agreed in principle with the benefits of unit tests but as I wanted to see something working more than write boring test code, I just dived into the coding without writing any unit tests. But as the lines of code accumulated and the complexity grew, weird bugs started cropping up and having a solid coverage of unit tests as a safety net started sounding better and better.</p>\\n<p>So I stopped coding and spent a day studying unit testing and <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/simpletest\\\">SimpleTest</a> (the testing framework Drupal uses). There was a painful learning curve to wrap my head around the concepts but just a few days of coding with unit tests has made me a convert.</p>\\n<p>A quick example of how SimpleTest has helped me improve the quality of my code.</p>\\n<p>Memetracker tries to present to readers the most interesting memes (conversations around a topic) to readers on a web page. To learn which memes are interesting, Memetracker records the articles people click on from the memebrowsing page. By counting clicks, memetracker can calculate an interestingness score for the different memes and from that score, determine which memes to display and in what order.</p>\\n<p>When a person clicks on a article, that information is sent from the browser to the memetracker module. In memetracker.module is a function, memetracker_set_click(), which saves the click information to a table in the database.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to make sure this function works correctly so I wrote a unit test which sent a fake click to the memetracker_set_click function and then tested that the click was actually saved to the database.</p>\\n<p>So I wrote the test. . . and it worked!</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/82268668@N00/2625633427/\\\" title=\\\"click_test by kylenumber5, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"./2625633427_4fa80978a2_o.png\\\" alt=\\\"click_test\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>But wait a second – I thought – it shouldn’t of worked. To save the click data a memetracker object has to be loaded which then does the actual saving of the click information. But when I wrote the unit test, I had made up an id for the memetracker object. All information for different memetracker objects are stored in the database (one website can have multiple memetrackers). If a memetracker didn’t exist in the database, it shouldn’t be loaded.</p>\\n<p>I had already written some code to validate that a memetracker object existed before loading but somehow that validation wasn’t working. I looked at the validation code and quickly found the problem. Problem solved, and to ensure this didn’t happen again I wrote a new unit test to ensure my validation code works correctly in the future.</p>\\n<p>Unit tests are valuable for any coding project longer than a few lines. Once you get past the learning curve, writing new tests are easy. And it’s a great feeling after making changes to run my tests and know in seconds everything is still working as it should.</p>\\n<p>To learn more about unit testing, read <a href=\\\"http://www.lullabot.com/about/angiebyron\\\">Angie Bryon’s (webchick)</a> great blog post about how <a href=\\\"http://www.lullabot.com/articles/drupal-module-developer-guide-simpletest\\\">unit tests let you to refactor without fear</a>.

It also knows how to pull in new content as a dumb aggregator but it’s much smarter about how it displays the content. It can analyze the text of the content and know which authors are talking about the same topic and then group them together. But not only will the smart aggregator group similar topics but it will also learn what topics and authors are most interesting to members of the community and display those first. No more will you have to scroll through a long list of content skipping over content you’re not interested in but instead, new content will be nicely organized by meme and interestingness in a neat compact form.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>To join in the work of building an open source memetracker, join the <a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org/memetracker\\\">Memetracker group</a> at <a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org\\\">groups.drupal.org</a>.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 456 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"What is the key metric to measure Learning2.0?\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"elearning2.0\",\"Learning\",\"conversation\",\"byu\"],\"date\":\"2008-07-18T21:57:59.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>This was a comment I left on Jon Mott’s blog post, <a href=\\\"http://www.jonmott.com/blog/?p=17#comment-937077\\\">Getting From Here to There</a>.

This metric would be used to guide building decisions and to measure success.</p>\\n<p>In the book “Good to Great”, an important event in the transitions of good companies to great companies was identifying a key metric or denominator as the book calls it.</p>\\n<p>The process of picking and using this denominator served as a mechanism to push deeper understanding of the company’s economic engine. The companies asked themselves this question &quot;If we could only pick one and only one ratio – profit per x – to systematically increase over time, what x would have the greatest and most sustainable impact on our economic engine?</p>\\n<p>Wells Fargo went through this process during bank deregulation:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Consider Wells Fargo. When the Wells team confronted the brutal fact that deregulation would transform banking into a commodity, they realized that standard banker metrics, like profit per loan and profit per deposit, would no longer be the key drivers. Instead, they grasped a new denominator: <em>profit per employee</em>. Following this logic, Wells Fargo became one of the first banks to change its distribution to rely primarily on stripped-down branches and ATMs.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Because Wells Fargo understood their key economic drivers, they were able to a) encapsulate this logic through identifying a new denominator and b) use this logic to make many highly successful changes.</p>\\n<p>So my question is what are the key drivers of BYU’s (and other school’s) learning engine? What denominator or key metric offers the best insight as we plan / build / measure / proselyte new online technologies in education?</p>\\n<p>My suggestion would be conversations on learning topics per student per day.</p>\\n<p>I love Robert Scoble’s (social media figure) goal to <a href=\\\"http://scobleizer.com/2008/04/10/not-productive-enough-turn-off-the-internet/\\\">have an interesting conversation every day</a>. Conversations with others seems an important key to learning almost anything.</p>\\n<p>My best educational experience by far here at BYU was the Information Systems Junior Core – It’s 24 credits over two semesters. I was placed in a group of four and spent eight hours a week sitting next to my group members. Almost all of our projects were group projects and those that weren’t we often ended up working together anyways. Everything about the core was designed to push us students to talk to one another. A mailing list was set up for the ~110 students in the core. It saw heavy usage with students asking / answering questions about all sorts of class / ISys related questions.</p>\\n<p>The effect of all this was conversation, lots of it. Because of these conversations (and great professors / projects) I learned far more and I had much more fun than in other classes here. We talked so much about ISys / non ISys topics that many of us became good friends. I looked forward to class because I was going to see my friends.</p>\\n<p>By comparison, in most other classes I learn in isolation. I don’t get to know other students very well so I don’t talk much with them about the subject so I learn less and the class is much more boring.</p>\\n<p>My take on all this is we learn best with friends who are striving to become what we are striving to become.</p>\\n<p>Obviously not every classroom experience at BYU can hope to replicate what’s done in the ISys Junior Core but I think much could be improved. The types of assignments given (e.g. more group work) and the integration of social software tools that make it easier for students and professors to connect online and offline would do much to help more conversations happen at BYU which would dramatically increase the quality and quantity of education.</p>\\n<p>What do you all think?</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 457 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"My educational philosophy\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"entrepreneurship\",\"Learning\"],\"date\":\"2008-09-10T14:43:20.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>A book I read recently helped me finger out why school can be so irritating at times.</p>\\n<p>The book is entitled <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Weird-Ideas-That-Work-Sustaining/dp/0743212126\\\">Weird Ideas that Work: 11 1/2 Practices for Promoting, Managing, and Sustaining Innovation</a>. One of its “weird ideas” is that companies should hire slow learners. Not stupid people but slow learners of the organization’s code. A code is, the author explains, “a company’s ‘knowledge and faiths,’ its history, memories, procedures, precedents, rules, and all those taken-for-granted, and often unspoken, assumptions about why things are supposed to be done in certain ways.”</p>\\n<p>He goes on to say that most companies hire “fast learners” who quickly learn to do things the “right way” and see things much as others do in the company. But companies that do innovative work need a different kind of worker, one who won’t get “brainwashed into thinking just like everyone else. They need people who avoid, ignore, or reject ‘the heat of the herd. . .’”</p>\\n<p>How do you find this sort of person? One suggestion he made is to hire smart people with bad grades. He says research has shown that many creative geniuses–including Edison and Darwin–were poor students.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Creativity researcher Dean Keith Simonton points out: “To obtain high marks in school often requires a high degree of conformity to conventional ways of looking at the world and people.” People who get good grades are often fast learners of social cues. By contrast, smart people who get bad grades are listening to their inner voice, doing <em>what they believe is interesting and right</em>. Simonton observes that “one of the reasons creative talents often dislike school is that it can interfere with <em>what they really want to know</em>. When faced with the choice of reading a good book or studying for an exam, the extracurricular but still instructive diversion may win out.” [italics mine]</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>School irritates me because I’m often told by teachers to do things and learn things I don’t think are valuable. I have strong opinions about where I’m going and what I need to know to get there. When demands from school align with my own interests, things go well. But when they clash, school loses out.</p>\\n<p>One of my guiding principles is maintaining control of my own destiny. I cede control of my experiences only to those with whom I have an unusual amount of trust. The trust threshold a person must meet before I’m willing to give up control varies upon the importance of the activity but for learning especially, it is very high. There is nothing more important than what I know, what I think, and especially how I think. My thoughts are my destiny. And when I let someone influence my thoughts, my destiny partially becomes theirs. And there are very few teachers indeed with whom I want to share destinies.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 458 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Memetracker module gets some press\",\"tags\":[\"memetracker\"],\"date\":\"2008-09-17T22:08:08.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>The <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/memetracker\\\">Memetracker module</a> I worked on this past summer for Google Summer of Code saw some press today. <a href=\\\"http://webdevnews.net/2008/09/memetracker-module-released-for-drupal/\\\">Web Dev News wrote</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>One of the most powerful and innovative modules to be developed for Drupal this year is Memetracker.

The module is a “smart aggregator” that can analyze the actual text of RSS feeds and group posts with related content into categories that can be displayed on a website.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://webdevnews.net/2008/09/memetracker-module-released-for-drupal/\\\">Read the rest.</a></p>\\n<p>I still find it rather weird to see my name in print (digital or otherwise) but it’s nice to see the module getting some notice.

The article nails the problem with most social media / knowledge management installations in organizations.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The difficulty in most knowledge management effort lies in <em>changing organizational culture and people’s work habits</em>. It lies in getting people to <em>take the time to articulate and share the really good stuff</em>. If a group of people don’t already share knowledge, don’t already have plenty of contact, don’t already <em>understand what insights and information will be useful to each other</em>, information technology is not likely to create it. However, most knowledge management efforts treat these cultural issues as secondary, implementation issues. They typically focus on information systems–identifying what information to capture, constructing taxonomies for organizing information, determining access, and so on. <strong>The great trap in knowledge management is using information management tools and concepts to design knowledge management systems.</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Sharing useful knowledge is a skill that few people learn to use effectively. The past year and a half for various reasons I’ve heavily involved myself in the <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org\\\">Drupal</a> open source community. One of the most fascinating things I’ve seen and learned from is how members of the community share knowledge. Drupal has a very effective knowledge sharing culture. What I’ve learned is that it’s the <em>people</em> that make the Drupal culture effective not so much the tools or processes that the Drupal community has created.</p>\\n<p>People who become members of open source communities love to create and share knowledge. The people who are attracted to these kinds of communities have a passion for sharing and collaboratively creating knowledge. Another difference is the incentive structures. Open source communities are <a href=\\\"http://www.communitywiki.org/en/DoOcracy\\\">do-ocracies</a>. People have power and influence within the Drupal community because they <em>do</em> something. They write code, they write documentation, they answer questions in the forums, and so on. People who <em>do</em> things get the respect and trust of their peers. In open source communities, both the people and the incentive structure encourage knowledge sharing.</p>\\n<p>So even with the twin disadvantages of using relatively unsophisticated collaboration software and that most contributors don’t work closely together; open source communities’ “knowledge management” systems stand as gleaming pillars of success next to the smoking hulks of the many multi-million dollar knowledge management systems developed and abandoned by major corporations. Any organization that wants to develop a strong knowledge sharing culture would do well to study the successes of the many open source communities. Organizations must find or develop the right kind of people and create the right incentive structures.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 460 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Content Recommendation\",\"tags\":[\"memetracker\",\"drupal planet\",\"content recommendation\"],\"date\":\"2008-10-14T00:26:11.000Z\",\"draft\":true,\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>New Note 66</p>\\n<p>Each one of us wakes up everyday with a problem. A problem we must solve in order to have a successful day. The problem is finding the right information. Without the right information, we can’t choose a good breakfast, catch the bus to work, find a restaurant, call a client, buy the right stock, cook chicken noodle soup, help a child with homework or complete any of the other billion and one tasks we do daily. If the information we know is either of bad quality or missing important pieces then we are poor employees, poor parents, poor friends, and live a life far short of its potential. If we know something we can do something. On the flip side, if we don’t know something then we are unable to do something. If we don’t know the bus time or bus number, we can’t ride it to work. If we don’t know a client’s number, then we can’t call them. If we don’t know a restaurant’s number then we’re unable to eat there. This is a vitally important point. We can’t do what we don’t know. If we know little we do little.</p>\\n<p>Knowing and understanding things is a topic I’ve thought about deeply for a long time. Specifically about mechanisms we use on the individual, community and society-wide basis for identifying and propagating the most interesting and relevant news. This past summer, I worked on building an open-source memetracker for the Drupal social publishing platform as part of Google Summer of Code. Memetrackers are one technique used for creating automated news sites similar to Google News and Techmeme (see my original proposal to Google Summer of Code for more details). In this blog post I want to take a more holistic approach for examining the question of what exactly is content recommendation and why do we need it. Finally, I’ll use my analysis to make a recommendation for creating a general purpose content recommendation engine that can be implemented in Drupal (and other online systems).</p>\\n<p>We need information to live. We need content recommendation because we can’t, by ourselves, get all the information we need. How much harder would all of our lives be if each of us, individually, had to figure out the bus schedule in our city? Probably billions of man-hours are saved yearly just because one of the employees of each bus company is responsible for creating a bus schedule and posting it online or in a booklet. In a similar fashion, think how useful are books. If you were a bit curious about astronomy and wanted to learn some think how difficult it’d be, unaided, to start to grasp what astronomy is all about. Books are so convenient. An expert in the field spends several months of their life distilling the most important important information for a beginner like you. One lazy Saturday afternoon with that book and you will know more about the subject then months of stumbling about trying to understand. And how did we find information before Google? Google (and other search engines) are critical for finding that very small needle of information in the very large haystack that is the internet.</p>\\n<p>In short, we need help finding the right information; we need content recommendation. As my examples show there are times we need help because information is scare, there are times we need help because there is too much information and we need help filtering out the unneeded information so we’re left with a managable and digestable chunk. And at times, the right content is already available, we just need someone to point it out.</p>\\n<p>What kind of content recommendation tools do we already use? I already mentioned a few, books and Google. In addition we use airfare searching sites, we read magazines, we ask librarians, we watch TV, we follow blogs, we talk to friends, we go to conferences, we join community groups, we join trade groups, we attend debates, and the list goes on and on. All of these are an effort to find information that is most relevant and most interesting for our particular needs.</p>\\n<p>From thinking about all this, I’ve concluded that all content recommendation is the result of a process comprised of the following steps: filtering, organization, and display.</p>\\n<p>If our starting point is all the information in the universe and our ending goal is useful and relevant information a filter is something which removes information, an organizer is something that sorts information into categories, and a displayer is set of decisions on how to display the filtered and organized information specifically the choice of what information to emphesize (and not) and what information you’ll make easily accessible and what information you will not.</p>\\n<p>Consider the following two examples of content recommendation. I’ve broken down two content recommendation processes into their individual steps of filtering, organizing, and displaying information. The first process is the one used by my <a href=\\\"/drupal-memetracker-module-my-google-summer-of-code-application\\\">Drupal memetracker module</a> I wrote this summer. The second is the steps used by a typical US local newspaper.</p>\\n<p><strong>The Color Key</strong>:</p>\\n<p>Current state (size and type) of content</p>\\n<p><em>Filters</em> remove content</p>\\n<p><em>Organizers</em> sort content or place content into categories</p>\\n<p><em>Displays</em> are the final decision about what content you emphasize and make easily accessible. . . and what content you don’t</p>\\n<h3>Memetracker Filter Flowchart:</h3>\\n<p>Every last bit of content in the Universe</p>\\n<p>1. Filter: What content sources will be imported into memetracker?</p>\\n<p>All content imported from choosen content sources since the sources were added</p>\\n<p>2. Filter: Was the content written in the past 48 hours?</p>\\n<p>All content from online sources that was written in the past 48 hours</p>\\n<p>3. Organize: Cluster content by meme</p>\\n<p>4. Organize: Sort memes by size, age, and other factors</p>\\n<p>All content from online sources that was written in the past 48 hours now organized by meme</p>\\n<p>5. Filter: Is the meme one of the top 15?</p>\\n<p>6. All content from online sources that was written in the past 48 hours that are part of the top 15 memes</p>\\n<p>7. Display: Show headlines with related articles hidden</p>\\n<h3>Local Newspaper Filter Flowchart:</h3>\\n<p>Every last bit of content in the Universe</p>\\n<p>1. Filter: Is the content local news?</p>\\n<p>All local news from since last publication of newspaper</p>\\n<p>2. Filter: Will the content be interesting to the locals?</p>\\n<p>All local news from last publication of the newspaper that reporters/editors think will be interesting</p>\\n<p>3. Filter: What part of the news story should we include?</p>\\n<p>4. Organize: Categorize stories (politics, sports, etc.)</p>\\n<p>All interesting local news now organized by story.</p>\\n<p>5. Display: Print most important stories “above the fold”</p>\\n<p>give examples of how the following filter/organize/display content - new york times, a book, a memetracker (interlinking and link popularity), a personalized social news recommnder (like findory)</p>\\n<p>First filter by far the most important – determains charecter of filter, what this filter is – newspaper we show only local news. this memetracker is about soil erosion news in the midwestern states in the united states. Take filter from infinite possiblities to very finite. Further filtering, organizing, and display is merely a polishing process</p>\\n<p>Call these filters – organizing and display is secondary. They’re just aids to understanding filtered data but once data is gone it is gone and can’t be recreated by the consumer of the filtered content.</p>\\n<p>Every choice of how and when to filter, organize,</p>\\n<p>and display is a reflection of the filter creator’s</p>\\n<p>bias and has implications for what the consumer</p>\\n<p>of the now filtered content will understand,</p>\\n<p>belive, and do.</p>\\n<p>Initial filter follows leader intent from making it stick</p>\\n<p>Filter = remove content</p>\\n<p>organize = sort content or place content in categories</p>\\n<p>display = what content you emphesize and make easily assible. . . and what content you don’t</p>\\n<p>A small Drupal note. This model fits very well into the views paradigm. I suggest that all content recommendation modules be consolidated within the views framework. For example, memetracker would be an organizer, you could filter by how many days you wanted, sort by interestingness of memes etc.</p>\\n<p>visual of steps of filtering and organizing and displaying news</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 461 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Internet reduces need for experts.

In this brave new world with near ubiquitous digital knowledge, what then are professors good for?</p>\\n<p>They aren’t nearly as valuable at teaching explicit knowledge so what’s left is to teach tacit knowledge (knowledge that’s hard to learn from reading). What tacit knowledge? I’d suggest the most important tacit knowledge that professors can help students learn is how to ask the right questions in their field. How do students learn to ask the right questions? By joining and <strong>participating</strong> in communities of practice.</p>\\n<p>I see Island’s (and other web2.0 tools) greatest potential is in exposing and connecting students more easily to active participants in different communities of practice. Through this exposure and connections they can learn to emulate these experts through experiencing and doing what experts experience and do.</p>\\n<p>Good learning is learning to <strong>be</strong> something not learning <strong>about</strong> something.

I believe as guides. They can lead students into communities of practice and can model proper behavior and attitudes.

In our current courses, some are appropriately challenged but many others are bored and dissatisfied. Classes are not customizable by students to meet their needs or to fit their learning styles. In addition there are many subjects students would like to learn (the long-tail of education) that there isn’t enough demand to justify allocating a classroom and teacher. Most students already spend considerable time outside of school learning things not taught in their courses. This course would give them access to resources at school most importantly their peers as they study advanced topics in small groups.</p>\\n<p>The course would be divided into three 6-week segments. In each segment, the student creates a learning project where they create both a learning goal and a learning plan. The learning plan will include the steps to reach their learning goal and a list of resources they will use which can include people and materials (books, OpenCourseWare, online resources, etc.). This learning plan will be reviewed by other students and a teacher before being passed off. Students can also “cite” other learning plans in their proposal creating a marketplace for learning plans. After learning plans are finalized, students will be organized into groups of 3-7 people who all are studying similar topics. These groups will meet weekly while students are working on their project.</p>\\n<h4>Diagram of a six-week segment.</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/82268668@N00/2969785767/\\\" title=\\\"openstudies by kylenumber5, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"./2969785767_ce6ff99643_b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"openstudies\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>During the segment, students will be asked to share what they are learning. Each week they’ll make a post in an Island group about helpful resources they’ve found and/or how they solved a obstacle in their project. The last week of the segment is devoted to teaching what they learned. Each student will be asked to teach in a digital form what they learned and post it on Island. This could be as simple as a blog post or as elaborate as a screencast, a video, or podcast. In addition students will be asked to participate in an Ignite session (<a href=\\\"http://ignite.oreilly.com/\\\">http://ignite.oreilly.com/</a>) and an <a href=\\\"http://www.digital-web.com/articles/understanding_the_unconference/\\\">Unconference</a>. Ignite sessions are where each presenter has 5 minutes on stage with 20 slides which rotate automatically every 15 seconds. An Unconference is a new form of conferences organized on the premise that all attendees have something valuable to say. Students will be asked to attend the unconference held the final week and either present or blog some of the presentations.</p>\\n<p>This course would produce a rapidly growing collection of valuable learning plans and learning resources useful to students and teachers alike. They will be useful to students who are taking the Open Studies class and need a good learning plan or who are studying outside of school. They will be useful teachers who are looking for new and innovative ways to help students learn.</p>\\n<p>Teachers would have a different role in the Open Studies class. They would be mentors or coaches. They would help advanced students who are passionate about a subject complete effective projects. They would help train students to be proficient, self-directed, lifelong, and wise learners.</p>\\n<p>There is a huge unmet demand for specialized classes in my major, Information Systems, and elsewhere across the BYU campus. I for one would love to take a classes on social network analysis, cloud computing, and Javascript UI design, none of which are available.

My project will be to make it possible for organizations to easily meet this need. I will work on two Drupal modules, write documentation, and build a Drupal install profile so that organizations can easily add sophisticated news aggregation and recommendation tools into their Drupal website.</p>\\n<p>The two Drupal modules I will improve are Memetracker and Content Recommendation Engine.</p>\\n<p>I wrote Memetracker as part of the 2008 Google Summer of Code. The Memetracker module uses machine learning algorithms to intelligently filter and group all types of content. The module’s purpose is to find and display to a community in real time the most interesting conversations and memes on relevant topics as they emerge.</p>\\n<p>My goal for the memetracker module is for it emulate functionality of successful commercial memetrackers such as Techmeme, Google News, Tailrank, and Megite. I want it to be a robust open-source implementation of memetracking technology that can be easily plugged into Drupal-based community sites.</p>\\n<p>The Content Recommendation Engine module is designed to provide personalized content recommendation. It learns what types of content individuals are interested in and recommends new content as it comes in.</p>\\n<p>Both modules are powerful ideas but need quite a bit of work to be usable in real-life situations. I would use the Knight Foundation money to do fix bugs, add requested functionality, and to create an install profile which makes it very easy for non-technical end-users to install a sophisticated Drupal-based news aggregation and recommendation site.</p>\\n<h3>How will your project improve the way news and information are delivered to geographic communities?</h3>\\n<p>There are many tools available to communities to aggregate and distribute information. What’s missing are open source tools which leverage not just human intelligence to filter content but also artificial intelligence.</p>\\n<p>There is far too much information for any person or organization to sort through manually. These automated tools can be thought of as pre-processors that improve the signal-to-noise ratio reducing the stress people endure trying to follow news. By filtering out the noise, important news is much more likely to be identified and acted upon.</p>\\n<h3>How is your idea innovative? (new or different from what already exists)</h3>\\n<p>There are not any open source tools that do the automated content filtering and recommendation these two tools will do. In addition, the few tools that are similar to these are standalone applications where as my work would be built on Drupal, the most widely used open-source social publishing platform. This means two things. First, my tools would get wider adoption as they would fit into many organization’s existing technology stack. Second, they are more useful as they can take advantage of many other powerful modules available for Drupal. The tools will be the basic building blocks of a rich flowering of content aggregation / filtering web applications based on these modules and Drupal.</p>\\n<h3>What experience do you or your organization have to successfully develop this project?</h3>\\n<p>I was a <a href=\\\"/drupal-memetracker-module-my-google-summer-of-code-application\\\">Google Summer of Code student</a> this past summer where I wrote the Memetracker module.</p>\\n<p>I traveled to Drupalcon in Hungary and presented there on the Memetracker module and on content filtering in general.

The teachers were reporting on their experiences in teaching a course on creativity to freshmen college students. They reported on some things that happened and we did some of the exercises they do in their classes. I was disappointed though as the session leaders focused on teaching the <em>behaviors</em> of creative people while completely missing what’s driving these behaviors.</p>\\n<p>Love is at the heart of all creative acts.</p>\\n<p>I can think of three reasons.</p>\\n<p>A creative thought is just another word for an excellent thought. Most ideas are average. Most people settle for ideas that are “good enough.” And why not? Thinking is hard and if the first idea that comes along is “good enough”, why not use it? But if you truly love something, you can’t settle for “good enough.” Think of any great athlete. They are great because their love for the game pushes them to practice more than comparable athletes. Any great artist, musician, architect is driven by their <em>passion</em> for the art. Even in fields not normally considered “creative”, the best in that field are the best because of their love for their craft. They do great and creative things because their love for their work pushes them beyond the “good enough.”</p>\\n<p>Fear of failure drives people to be average. Fear of failure recedes as hope, driven by love, takes its place. Most people are driven primarily by fear. They settle for the “safe” answer. They do the sure thing, take the safe job, do what pleases the client, etc. People who love something <em>can’t</em> settle on what’s safe as anything but the best for their beloved is not acceptable. Creative people, driven by love, behave recklessly in the eyes of their “saner” cousins.</p>\\n<p>People who love something pay attention to what they love. If you pay attention to something, you will soon know much more about the thing you love than those who don’t pay attention to it. By knowing more about this thing you will soon have better ideas on how to improve this thing than someone who doesn’t love this thing. A parent who loves their children will talk and play with them and get to know them and by knowing them better becomes a better parent. A teacher who loves their students will learn their sometimes hidden strengths and weaknesses and learn how to nurture each in the way most suited. And the same is every case you can imagine. The man who loves his town will pay attention to it and soon have better, more creative, ideas on how to improve it.

For someone like me who thrives on doing things, bureaucracy is a nightmare.</p>\\n<p>Another of my favorite authors, Paul Graham, wrote a great essay along the same vein today, talking about the <a href=\\\"http://www.paulgraham.com/artistsship.html\\\">gradual build-up of checks and processes</a> and the very real cost those checks impose upon all of us.</p>\\n<p>Some of my favorite parts:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>One of the differences between big companies and startups is that big companies tend to have developed procedures to protect themselves against mistakes. A startup walks like a toddler, bashing into things and falling over all the time. A big company is more deliberate.</p>\\n<p>The gradual accumulation of checks in an organization is a kind of learning, based on disasters that have happened to it or others like it. After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankrupt and fails to deliver, for example, a company might require all suppliers to prove they’re solvent before submitting bids.</p>\\n<p>As companies grow they invariably get more such checks, either in response to disasters they’ve suffered, or (probably more often) by hiring people from bigger companies who bring with them customs for protecting against new types of disasters.</p>\\n<p>It’s natural for organizations to learn from mistakes. The problem is, people who propose new checks almost never consider that the check itself has a cost.</p>\\n<p>…</p>\\n<p>Whenever someone in an organization proposes to add a new check, they should have to explain not just the benefit but the cost. No matter how bad a job they did of analyzing it, this meta-check would at least remind everyone there had to be a cost, and send them looking for it.</p>\\n<p>If companies started doing that, they’d find some surprises. Joel Spolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling software to corporate customers. He said that in most companies software costing up to about $1000 could be bought by individual managers without any additional approvals. Above that threshold, software purchases generally had to be approved by a committee. But babysitting this process was so expensive for software vendors that it didn’t make sense to charge less than $50,000. Which means if you’re making something you might otherwise have charged $5000 for, you have to sell it for $50,000 instead.</p>\\n<p>The purpose of the committee is presumably to ensure that the company doesn’t waste money. And yet the result is that the company pays 10 times as much.</p>\\n<p>…</p>\\n<p>In more recent times, Sarbanes-Oxley has practically destroyed the US IPO market [Ha! My accounting teachers never mentioned this]. That wasn’t the intention of the legislators who wrote it. They just wanted to add a few more checks on public companies. But they forgot to consider the cost. They forgot that companies about to go public are usually rather stretched, and that the weight of a few extra checks that might be easy for General Electric to bear are enough to prevent younger companies from being public at all.</p>\\n<p>…</p>\\n<p>Programmers are unlike many types of workers in that the best ones actually prefer to work hard. This doesn’t seem to be the case in most types of work. When I worked in fast food, we didn’t prefer the busy times. And when I used to mow lawns, I definitely didn’t prefer it when the grass was long after a week of rain.</p>\\n<p>Programmers, though, like it better when they write more code. Or more precisely, when they release more code. Programmers like to make a difference. Good ones, anyway.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Great stuff, <a href=\\\"http://www.paulgraham.com/artistsship.html\\\">read the whole thing</a>.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 467 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Some words of wisdom\",\"tags\":null,\"date\":\"2008-12-01T00:34:44.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<blockquote>\\n<p>The slenderest knowledge that may be obtained of higher things is more desirable than the most certain knowledge that may be obtained of lesser things</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Thomas Aquinas</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 468 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Enterprise 2.0 Slides\",\"tags\":[\"enterprise2.0\"],\"date\":\"2008-12-11T16:41:56.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Presentation from one of my classes in Information Systems.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <iframe src=\\\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/838583\\\" width=\\\"427\\\" height=\\\"356\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" style=\\\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px 1px 0; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\\\" allowfullscreen> </iframe>\\n</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 469 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"In social media there's not one right answer\",\"tags\":[\"enterprise2.0\",\"social software\",\"social media\"],\"date\":\"2008-12-13T18:31:53.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Great blog post that explores the advantages and disadvantages of different social media structures.</p>\\n<p>He explores when you want to follow ideas (when the community is small) or people (when the community is too big to follow everything).</p>\\n<p>He discusses the search/browse debate and concludes you need both.

First up is an article on social objects.</em></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The Social Object, in a nutshell, is the reason two people are talking to each other, as opposed to talking to somebody else.\\n– <a href=\\\"http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/004390.html\\\">Hugh Macleod</a></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>As humans we like to socialize but in order to socialize, we need a reason to get together. Social objects provide that reason.</p>\\n<h3>Some examples of social objects</h3>\\n<p>You and John are coworkers on a team working on the launch of a new microsite for your company. Your company, team, and project are all social objects.</p>\\n<p>You and Fred are both Information Systems majors and have become friends as you study for tests and do homework together. Your major, classes, and homework assignments are social objects.</p>\\n<p>Your wife wants to throw a big birthday party for you so she can invite all of her and your friends. The birthday party is a social object.</p>\\n<p>Sue holds a tea party every Sunday evening. She invites all her friends and they come as they can. The tea party is a social object.</p>\\n<h3>Social objects bind us together.</h3>\\n<p>The more important a social object is to us, the stronger it’ll bind us to others who also hold that social object. I love <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org\\\">Drupal</a> and spend a good part of my time using it to build <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu\\\">cool websites</a>. As I meet others who also loves Drupal, we immediately have a strong connection through that shared social object.</p>\\n<p>When you meet someone new or go on a first date, you start asking questions hoping to find “something in common” or shared social objects.</p>\\n<p>If you date someone for a few months then break up, the reason you’ll often give is, “we just didn’t have much in common.”</p>\\n<p>Families develop traditions. My family eats fancy sandwiches each Christmas Eve. The shared memories and rituals we’ve developed bind us together. Traditions are social objects.</p>\\n<h3>Social objects come in all sorts of types and strength</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2007/08/what-makes-a-go.html\\\">Good social objects</a> are complex and have lots of hooks around which to start conversations. A football game has history, statistics, personalities, rivalries, and a plot with heroes, goats, and momentum shifts. All of which provide rich meat for discussion before, during and after the game.</p>\\n<h3>We change our behavior because of social objects</h3>\\n<p>If your coworkers are NBA fans and there’s a big game one night, you’ll watch the game so you can talk about it with your coworkers the next day. You buy that silly new iPhone app so you can share it with your coworkers. You join Facebook because all your friends are there. The NBA game, your new iPhone app, and Facebook are all social objects.</p>\\n<p>But it’s important to remember that it’s not the social objects that matter but people. Loving and being loved is what matters. Social objects are just the tool we use to make it happen.</p>\\n<p>Next I’ll write about <a href=\\\"/how-design-social-networking-site-using-social-objects\\\">how social object theory can help us build better social networking websites</a>.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 471 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"How to design a social networking site using social objects\",\"tags\":[\"social software\",\"drupal planet\",\"social objects\",\"social networking\"],\"date\":\"2009-02-27T18:20:59.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"readNext\":\"/what-are-social-objects/\",\"body\":\"<p>This is the second in a series of articles I’m writing to help me prep for my <a href=\\\"http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/building-advanced-social-networks-large-us-university\\\">session next week at Drupalcon</a>. The first article was my attempt to <a href=\\\"/what-are-social-objects\\\">define social objects</a>. This article outlines how to use social object theory to design better social networking sites.</p>\\n<p>First a review of <a href=\\\"http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/004390.html\\\">what are social objects</a>. “The Social Object is the reason two people are talking to each other, as opposed to talking to somebody else.” People are social creatures. Social objects are the tools we use to create opportunities to socialize with other people. And lastly, for all their importance, objects are just a means to an end – the end is loving and being loved.</p>\\n<p>So social objects are a cool theory but how can they help me design my new social networking site (or fix my broken one)?</p>\\n<p>Jyri Engestrom, founder of <a href=\\\"http://jaiku.com/\\\">Jaiku</a>, answered this question in his blog post, “<a href=\\\"http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2005/04/why_some_social.html\\\">Why some social network services work and others don’t — Or: the case for object-centered sociality.</a>”</p>\\n<p>He argues:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>the term ‘social networking’ makes little sense if we leave out the objects that mediate the ties between people. Think about the object as the reason why people affiliate with each specific other and not just anyone. For instance, if the object is a job, it will connect me to one set of people whereas a date will link me to a radically different group. This is common sense but unfortunately it’s not included in the image of the network diagram that most people imagine when they hear the term ‘social network.’ The fallacy is to think that social networks are just made up of people. They’re not; social networks consist of people who are connected by a shared object.</p>\\n<p>The social networking services that really work are the ones that are built around objects. And, in my experience, their developers intuitively ‘get’ the object-centered sociality way of thinking about social life. Flickr, for example, has turned photos into objects of sociality. On <a href=\\\"http://del.icio.us\\\">del.icio.us</a> the objects are the URLs. EVDB, <a href=\\\"http://Upcoming.org\\\">Upcoming.org</a>, and evnt focus on events as objects.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Jyri wrote further that networking sites not based on social objects tend to not work as they are built on a flawed model for human interaction.</p>\\n<p>The steps then for designing your social networking site around social objects are first, pick the objects around which people will socialize, next, decide what users can do to the objects and finally, design how people can share the objects or other wise socialize around the objects. Or as <a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/chrismessina/statuses/1053693513\\\">Chris Messina</a> put it, “define the objects, name the verbs, network the objects”</p>\\n<p>Let’s look at some popular social networking sites and see how they’ve built their sites around social objects.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://flickr.com\\\">Flickr’s</a> social objects are pictures. People can do the following to pictures (the verbs): comment, annotate, tag, add them to sets and to groups, and share pictures through their URL.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://youtube.com\\\">YouTube’s</a> social objects are videos. People can watch, comment, rank, favorite, flag, create playlists of, and share objects.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://dogster.com\\\">Dogster’s</a> social objects are dogs (obviously). People can create profiles (for their dogs), give gifts, adopt other dogs, post videos and pictures, and find dog related businesses near their homes.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://drupal.org\\\">Drupal’s</a> social objects are Drupal (the software), the various modules in contrib and core, documentation pages, individual issues, and the various larger subtopics within the community such as documentation, social networking, education, and every other group found at <a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org\\\">groups.drupal.org</a> (each group is a social object).</p>\\n<p>Around issues in core and contrib, Drupalers can write issues, discuss issues on Twitter, IRC, email, blogs, enlist help on the issues through the same channels, and finally write code to solve issues.</p>\\n<p>Drupal, the social object, brings people to Drupalcon and various other meetups around the world. Drupal draws us to read Drupal planet and comment on people’s blogs. Drupal draws us to <a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/19480\\\">comment and support other developers</a> building sites with Drupal.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://horncologne.com/content/community_our_strength_drupal_epiphany\\\">As</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.matthewbull.net/2008/10/23/hooked-into-drupal/\\\">is</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.angrydonuts.com/i-was-voted-packt-publishing-drupal-most-valuable-player\\\">often</a> <a href=\\\"http://cmscritic.com/drupal-founder-dries-buytaert-interview\\\">mentioned</a>, the strength of Drupal is not the code but the community. The ideals and goals of Drupal (the idea not software) is what draws more and more people to the Drupal community. And as positive interaction builds upon positive interaction, the social object Drupal becomes more and more powerful.</p>\\n<p>Jyri commented upon this in <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiWjAVcWK4g\\\">a keynote he delivered last year</a>. There he showed a picture he’d taken of himself and his boy in a forest. He said this picture had value but when he placed the picture on Flickr and his friends commented on it the picture became much more valuable.</p>\\n<p>The picture had intrinsic value as an ‘object’ but became much more valuable when it became a ‘social object’. The comments by Jyri’s friends turned his picture into a social object. Or as <a href=\\\"http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/004318.html\\\">Hugh likes to put it</a>, “social gestures beget social objects.” And as social gestures accumulate, the more valuable the social object becomes.</p>\\n<p>JP Rangaswami created, what I think, is a <a href=\\\"http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2008/02/16/musing-about-social-objects-molluscs-that-matter/\\\">brilliant metaphor for understanding how social objects grow through conversations</a>. He compared the growth in value of a social object to the gradual adding of new layers to a pearl by an oyster.</p>\\n<p>He wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Conversations grow around social objects, much like pearls grow around microscopic dust. Social objects are about growth, they are “live”.</p>\\n<p>A successful social object is one that has layer upon layer of conversation created around it; as the number of participants increases, social objects enjoy network effects.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So to sum things up. To create a thriving social networking site, first choose good social objects for the core of your site and then create ways for people to share the social objects and socialize around them.</p>\\n<p>My next post will be on social learning or how social object theory can help us design websites which help people with similar interests connect to each other and learn together.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 472 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Ignite Salt Lake 2 Presentation\",\"tags\":[\"ignite\",\"ignite salt lake\",\"presentation\"],\"date\":\"2009-03-27T18:07:51.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I had a great time speaking last night at <a href=\\\"http://www.ignitesaltlake.com/ignite/index.cfm\\\">Ignite Salt Lake 2</a> on what we’re doing down at BYU with social networking in the classroom.

And talk about intimidation. I had a mild to strong case at different times of <a href=\\\"http://www.darcynorman.net/2009/08/20/on-the-open-education-experience/#comment-195623\\\">Chris Lott’s imposter syndrome</a>. So many brilliant thinkers. But I’m definitely glad I made the effort to go as I learned a great deal. Many of my assumptions were confirmed and many gaps in my understanding were exposed. So an excellent time of growth and learning.</p>\\n<p>The following is a few of the thoughts I had during the conference.</p>\\n<p>I loved the case studies some teachers presented about successes they’ve had in integrating social media tools into their classroom. These are brilliant teachers, visionary, willing to go the extra mile for their students, technologically adept – and really are showing the way to the future for the rest of us. But my concern is that as ed tech designers and creators that we’ll be misled by these examples.</p>\\n<p>These teachers are like a great pottery creator who makes brilliant one-off pieces of pottery art. Beautiful and inspiring but utterly useless at providing plates and bowls for the masses. Great teachers don’t scale. Their methods are incomprehensible and unusable by the average (or below-average teacher) which most students suffer with through their college experience.</p>\\n<p>A few quick cherry-picked (probably inaccurate) quotes from memory. <a href=\\\"http://openedconference.org/archives/549\\\">John Maxwell gave a session describing how he uses Wikis</a> to support Simon Fraser University Masters program in Publishing. He said he loved using wikis because the interface is just text. He could just edit different parts of the interface to quickly change it’s functionality. He described the technology, a plone-based wiki, as one of the less common wiki platforms but as being very powerful and versatile. I understood everything he said – but that’s because I’ve spent a considerable amount of time designing, using, and reading about wikis. But to your average professor, all of that would of been complete nonsense. Wikis? Textual interfaces? Plone? Another example, in David Wiley’s classes, students write blog posts and he collects these blog posts by using Google Reader – again, brilliant solution but how many teachers have a clue what a blog reader is, or for that matter, what a blog is. I love what these teachers are doing but the current method of using a grab-bag of free web2.0 social media tools to drive classroom learning is completely unusable for the vast majority of teachers and students.</p>\\n<p>The best teachers don’t realize how poor of teachers some of their colleagues are. Only students like me who have to sit through their classes can fully appreciate how wide the chasm is that separates the visionary resourceful teachers from the norm.</p>\\n<p>What we need to do is to study these visionary teachers, <a href=\\\"/presentation-opened-2009\\\">identify the successful patterns they’re using, and design social learning technology which implements these patterns</a> in a vastly simplified and consistent manner. Only then will these technologies and methods see large adoption across many universities around the world.</p>\\n<p>The first few days at the conference I was somewhat worried – perhaps as a consequence of my imposter syndrome. I started wandering if someone, somewhere had already figured everything out. I thought, surely with all this intellectual lightening crackling around me every problems been solved by now – which troubled me as I’m starting a company to develop a social learning platform – a worthless business if the works already been done.</p>\\n<p>But gradually, as the days went by, it dawned on me–everyone is as clueless as me! They’re has been brilliant insights made and illuminating experiments run – but things are still early. We’re still flailing around trying to figure things out. Which is good, I like to flail about experimenting with new ideas. That’s why I’m starting a new company in my apartment instead of sitting in a cubicle right now.</p>\\n<p>It was really interesting to me how differently I approach problems from the vast majority of people there at OpenEd. I’m at heart an engineer and by training a business person. I like to understand problems then solve them – preferably by building something cool. So it was remarkable for me to listen to conversations and sessions at OpenEd given by people almost entirely from a humanities / educational background. They framed and dissected problems in entirely different ways than me.

The orthodoxy goes something like this: Start with small-scale pilots, define your business objectives, watch the pilots closely, evaluate their success, make a go/no-go decision.</p>\\n<p>As far as I can tell it’s what everyone thinks. In fact, it’s what I used to think. Unfortunately, it’s dead wrong. The orthodoxy is wrong for a very simple reason: Size matters. By constraining the size of your pilot, you significantly alter the way your company can and will use the tools.</p>\\n<p>I’m not opposed to pilots for most enterprise IT solutions. Companies like to pilot new technologies with small populations before they roll them out enterprise-wide. That approach makes a lot of sense for transactional systems like order management, project management, purchasing, ERP, and so on. By piloting with a small group, you reduce implementation risk. You get a read on the value of the solution, and you get feedback which you can use to make modifications while those modifications are still relatively easy and inexpensive.</p>\\n<p>But social software is different from traditional IT. Traditional IT enables individuals to carry out well-defined, highly standardized transactions. Users go into the system to process transactions–to transfer funds, purchase supplies, track inventory, etc. The nature of these transactions, and the system’s ability to enable them, do not vary much according to the number of people using the system. Whether 100 people are entering orders or 10,000 people are entering orders, the transactions themselves doesn’t really change. What that means is that a representative small-scale sample is an accurate predictor of adoption and value at full scale.</p>\\n<p>But Enterprise 2.0 tools are different from traditional IT systems. Traditional IT enables <strong>transactions</strong>; Enterprise 2.0 enables <strong>interactions</strong>.</p>\\n<p>…</p>\\n<p>That doesn’t mean small-scale Enterprise 2.0 pilots can’t succeed. They can, and many do. But even when pilots succeed, they have limited ability to predict how the organization goes on to use the capabilities once they are rolled out enterprise-wide. Pilots typically fall into the lower left-hand corner of the <a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/04/the-social-software-value-matrix.html\\\">Social Software Value Matrix</a>: improve existing interactions within existing silos. That includes things like project team workspaces, departmental workspaces, and technical knowledgebases. When organizations really embrace Enterprise 2.0, however, they almost always play in multiple sections of the Value Matrix, launching solutions like collaborative intranets, ideation portals, private extranets, Those solutions, almost by definition, require scale.</p>\\n<p>Scale is the oxygen that feeds collaboration. That’s why collaborative tools like Facebook, and Twitter have taken off so spectacularly on the public web: With over a billion people on the Internet, the opportunities for interpersonal interaction are unbelievably high.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Ok, fair enough. Social software needs other people in order to work properly (imagine Facebook if it was just you there). What does that have to do with deploying a social learning platform at a university?</p>\\n<p>Before I answer that question, let me step back and explain a bit about what I mean by a social learning platform.</p>\\n<p>First it’s designed to support social learning meaning it’s designed to help/encourage/faciliate conversations and connections between like-minded learners as they pursue their personal learning goals.</p>\\n<p>Second it’s a platform giving the software two qualities:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>It gives people the freedom and tools to build onto the platform – in the case of a social learning platform, people will primarily build learning communities.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://andrewmcafee.org/2006/05/the_mechanisms_of_online_emergence/\\\">New patterns or structure will emerge within the system</a> that are unplanned and undirected</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The social learning platform should improve existing interactions and create new interactions within classrooms, within majors, and between multiple institutions such as nearby universities or members of the community (or in other words, create value in each of the quadrants within the <a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/04/the-social-software-value-matrix.html\\\">social software value matrix</a>).</p>\\n<p>My best stab at creating this tool can be seen at <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu\\\">https://island.byu.edu</a>–a tool I’ve been building for some time with the help of many others. Island provides simple tools to improve existing interactions and enable new interactions within classrooms, across campus, and eventually will have tools that will allow learners from multiple campuses interact.</p>\\n<p>So how should such a tool be deployed at a university?</p>\\n<p>Michael Idinopolus answers that question in a second article “<a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/09/launching-at-scale-.html\\\">Launch E2.0 Broad, Then Go Deep</a>” where he references <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2006/04/power_law_of_pa.html\\\">Ross Mayfield’s power law of participation graph</a>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/09/launching-at-scale-.html\\\"><img src=\\\"./power-law-participation.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>The key insight contained in the graph is that for different ways of participating in a social software environment there are different thresholds for joining. Reading takes little skill and effort while editing a wiki takes comparatively considerable more effort and community knowledge.</p>\\n<p>From this we’d also expect that the higher the threshold to participate in a certain way, the fewer people will participate. Survey results prove that out. While <a href=\\\"http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=879\\\">roughly 20-30% of Americans regularly read blogs</a>, only <a href=\\\"http://www.pewinternet.org/Commentary/2005/May/New-data-on-blogs-and-blogging.aspx\\\">6% of Americans have created a blog</a> (and probably considerably less regularly write updates).</p>\\n<p>I’ve seen the same sort of behavior on Island. I <a href=\\\"/power-law-graphs-from-classroom-community-website\\\">wrote a post on this subject last year</a> where I noticed a power law that emerged when I graphed the students participation in a number of different ways. I only posted two graphs in that post but the same relationship showed up across all types of participation. A few participated a great deal but most didn’t.</p>\\n<p>Returning to Michael’s article:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Historically, Enterprise 2.0 implementations have focused on collaborative tools [with] fairly high participation thresholds: blogs and wikis. That’s not by design, it’s by default. Until recently, those were the only Enterprise 2.0 tools that showed potential for high-value business use.</p>\\n<p>Today, Enterprise 2.0 participation is a whole different game. At the “low threshold” end of the curve, we have low-engagement tools like social messaging (internal “Twitter”), social bookmarking. By leading your implementation with these low-threshold tools, you lower the risk of implementation while still launching at the scale required for success.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>He goes on to describe an enthusiastic response to a recent webinar on his companies internal “twitter” app <a href=\\\"http://www.socialtext.com/products/signals.php\\\">Signals</a>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Signals was not just a useful tool, it was also a stepping stone that helped participants move to the right on the Participation curve (see image above). As participants started to get the hang of Signals, many started to ask about Socialtext’s other collaborative features: What are workspaces? How do I use the Dashboard? How do I look up an individual?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>From what I’ve seen, most social software deployments in universities have preceded in a similar way to what Michael describes – deploy high-value learning tools such as blogs and wikis in a small-pilot, evaluate their success, and make a go/no-go decision.</p>\\n<p>I think this is wrong for the same reasons Michael lists. First, a social learning platform needs large numbers of learners to work (“Scale is the oxygen that feeds collaboration”) and second, blogs and wikis are difficult tools to use – both the steepness of learning curve and the amount of time required to use them effectively. Relatively few students will ever use them to the extent that some of us wish.</p>\\n<p>In addition, I think we (grizzled web-heads who readily see the value of social software tools such as wikis and blogs in the classroom) frequently underestimate how scary and confusing these tools are to most teachers. These higher-threshold tools – they don’t get in general and definitely don’t get in specific, that is, how to use them in their classroom.</p>\\n<p>With Island we’ve focused on the bottom of the participation curve – enabling simple group-based conversations through email. For the past year we’ve been building and testing Island’s infrastructure within the Information Systems major. We’re now focused on achieving scale by inviting the rest of the BYU campus. Once we’ve achieved scale, we’ll (to quote Michael again) “deliver deep value by following up with local champions [deans, teachers, students] who want to invest time and effort in more robust, group-specific forms of collaboration.”</p>\\n<p>This, I think, is the correct sequence. Launch simply and broadly. Let students and teachers adjust to having a web-enabled learning environment. Then go deep by building into the social learning platform higher-value tools such as blogs, wikis, and other collaborative learning tools and workflows.</p>\\n<p>Your thoughts?</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 479 */\n373,\n/* 480 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"When in Doubt, Make it Public\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"social learning\"],\"date\":\"2009-09-10T00:15:20.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I recently (re)read a <a href=\\\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000840.html\\\">great post on Coding Horror</a> which pointed me towards an article by <a href=\\\"http://www.kottke.org/07/03/public-and-permanent/\\\">Jason Kottke who noted that many successful web2.0 projects</a> are a result of taking “something that everyone does with their friends and make it public and permanent.

Taking what was previously private (classroom discussions/instruction, hallway debate) and making it public, open, and permanent.</p>\\n<p>This is has many many powerful effects (all of which I won’t mention right now).

This, by default, filters ical feeds by date – e.g. only include events in the ical feed after a certain date. This works fine.</p>\\n<p>The problem we ran into is how to filter the ical feed by taxonomy terms. In Views we created a taxonomy term filter and exposed that to users so they can created custom calendar views of different event categories. That worked wonderfully. The problem was that when you downloaded the ical feed from the filtered calendar view, it included all events, not just events from the categories you’d selected.</p>\\n<p>After examining the url for the ical feed we found the problem.</p>\\n<p>The default ical URL that’s generated looks like this:</p>\\n<p><code>/aiocalendar/calendar/ical/2009-10?tid[2]=2&amp;tid[1]=1&amp;tid[3]=3&amp;tid[4]=4&amp;tid[5]=5&amp;tid[6]=6&amp;tid[7]=7</code></p>\\n<p>Views takes each url segment separated by a forward slash as arguments. <code>calendar/ical</code> tells views to return an ical representation of the calendar. <code>2009-10</code> tells views to only include events from October 2009 onward. But the next bit, <code>?tid[2][2]=2&amp;tid[1][1]=1&amp;tid[3][3]=3&amp;tid[4][4]=4&amp;tid[5]=5&amp;tid[6][5]=6&amp;tid[7][6]=7</code>, a list of term IDs that were currently active on the calendar view, weren’t working at helping Views produced a filtered ical feed.</p>\\n<p>Digging into the taxonomy term argument, I discovered it expected arguments in the form of <code>1+2+3</code> or <code>1,2,3</code>. <code>1+2+3</code> meaning Views would return events that had terms <code>1 OR 2 OR 3</code> and <code>1,2,3</code> meaning Views would return events that had terms <code>1 AND 2 AND 3</code>. For example, <code>aiocalendar/calendar/ical/2009-10/1+4+6</code> would return an ical feed of all events from October 2009 onward that had term ids of <code>1 or 4 or 6</code>.</p>\\n<p>I jumped to the command line and tested my theory by using wget and some handcrafted urls and it worked! The ical feeds I was getting only included events from categories I included as arguments in the URL.</p>\\n<p>Now the trick was to override the ical url generated to replace it with one in the correct format. I found the theme function in the Calendar module where the the ical feed icon was generated, copied that to my module, and rewrote the url using some regex kungfu (read more <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/node/11811\\\">on overriding theme functions</a> in the <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/handbooks\\\">Drupal handbook</a>).</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-php\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">&lt;?php</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">/*\\n * Override theme_calendar_ical_icon() so we can override the url produced.\\n */</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">phptemplate_calendar_ical_icon</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">($url)</span> </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Pull out array of Term IDs from the url.</span>\\n  $search = preg_match_all(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"/tid\\\\[([0-9])*\\\\]/\\\"</span>, $url, $matches);\\n  $tids = $matches[<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>];\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Grab url stem, we'll add the Term ID arguments back in a bit.</span>\\n  $search = preg_match(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"/(.*ical\\\\/)20[0-9]{2}-.*/\\\"</span>, $url, $url_stem);\\n\\n  $url = $url_stem[<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>];\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Views arguments treat a \\\"+\\\" between arguments as OR.</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// So we're crafting an argument that asks for all events which match one of the</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// term IDs.</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">foreach</span>($tids <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">as</span> $tid) {\\n    $url .= $tid . <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"+\\\"</span>;\\n  }\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Trim off extra +</span>\\n  $url = trim($url, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"+\\\"</span>);\\n\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> ($image = theme(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'image'</span>, drupal_get_path(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'module'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'date_api'</span>) .<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/images/ical16x16.gif'</span>, t(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Add to calendar'</span>), t(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Add to calendar'</span>))) {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&lt;div style=\\\"text-align:right\\\"&gt;&lt;a href=\\\"'</span>. check_url($url) .<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'\\\" class=\\\"ical-icon\\\" title=\\\"ical\\\"&gt;'</span>. $image .<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'</span>;\\n  }\\n}\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">?&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We’ll be releasing our calendar, custom code and all, as a feature on BYU’s own feature server once the new calendar is released to production.

With blogs, twitter, wikis, and other social media tools, our ability to share what we’re learning with others has increased dramatically. The shift from learning in private to learning in public is dramatic and chaotic, much like swimming from the edge of a river into the fast flowing current. All of a sudden you’re being pushed and tumbled along much faster than before.</p>\\n<p>I’m reading a book by Albert Bandura this semster called “Social Learning Theory.” Bandura was a psychologist in the mid to late 20th century who researched the role of <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Bandura\\\">social modeling on human motivation, thought, and action</a>. A lot of what I’m reading supports what I’ve experienced with learning in the open.</p>\\n<p>Here’s some of what he wrote on social modeling:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Learning would be exceedingly laborious, not to mention hazardous, if people had to rely solely on the effects of their own actions to inform them what to do. Fortunately, most human behavior is learned observationally through modeling: from observing others one forms an idea of how new behaviors are performed, and on later occasions this coded information serves as a guide for action. Because people can learn from example what to do, at least in approximate form, before performing any behavior, they are spared needless errors.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>One of the best parts about being an entrepreneur in this day and age is the many great learning resources on the internet. My favorite place to hangout on the internet is <a href=\\\"http://news.ycombinator.com/\\\">Hacker News</a>. There hackers (the good type) and entrepreneurs share interesting news and opinion posts and have conversations about them. Almost everything I know about entrepreneurship has come from joining and participating and emulating others within that community of makers who, to an incredible extent, learn in the open.</p>\\n<p>I started doing web development about three years ago – and at the time knew almost nothing really about building websites. But I made the decision then to join the Drupal community and learn web development using the Drupal social publishing platform. Since then I’ve learned an great deal about building sophisticated modern websites. I’ve been to two Drupal conferences and presented at both. I participated in the Google Summer of Code last year on a Drupal project. I’ve spent hundreds of hours reading blog posts from other Drupalers and hundreds more hours reading discussions between programmers about how to write different pieces of code studying how they think and solve technical problems. Almost everything I know about web development has come from my choice to involve myself in the Drupal community.</p>\\n<p>The problem with many classes in the University and K-12 is that teachers (and students) forget that learning is much more than the acquisition of facts and figures – learning is the process of becoming something. It’s the the process of becoming a full member of a <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice\\\">community of practice.</a></p>\\n<p>To become a physicist one for sure must learn physics equations. But much more than that, the student must learn to <em>be</em> a physicist – think and act like a physicist would. Approach problems like a physicist would.</p>\\n<p>If teachers ask students to learn in the open – through blogging, editing wikis, public discussions, etc – the more advanced students will serve as models for the rest and the student’s progress at learning to become a chemist, a mathematician, a programmer, or whatever the community may be that they are trying to enter, will accelerate. The progress is even greater if teachers actively model the thinking and problem-solving skills of that community.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.connectivism.ca/?p=122\\\">George Siemen’s explained the idea very well</a> when he wrote, “Watching others learn is an act of learning.”</p>\\n<p>He continued:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Let me explain. When someone decides to share their thoughts and ideas in a transparent manner, they become a teacher to those who are observing. Social technology – such as Twitter, blogs, Facebook – opens the door to sharing the process of learning, not only the final product.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>There’s a lot of promising educational ideas out there – but this one excites me probably the most of all of them. Why? because it’s so simple to implement. The teachers and students just have to do what they have been doing – but make it open. And then reap the benefits.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 484 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Organizing University Learning: Moving Beyond the Course to Micro-labs\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"Learning\",\"social networking\",\"social learning\",\"micro-labs\",\"universities\",\"courses\"],\"date\":\"2009-10-21T17:43:27.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>University learning is centered on the course.

This course design seeks to harness both the student’s natural (intrinsic) desire to learn and the ease of access to knowledge created by advances in communication technologies.</p>\\n<p>Micro-labs may be contrasted with a normal lab, which are found at most universities. Labs are large expensive operations that might take years to set-up and are expected to run for many years. Micro-labs, by contrast, are quick to set-up and cheap to run with as few as 2-3 students and a faculty adviser who meet in the Library. Many small, tightly networked micro-labs would collectively create an impact far beyond a few larger labs.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>[these micro-labs are] easier and quicker than large centers to plan, build and reconfigure as projects shift and move in other directions, they facilitate grassroots creative research. These highly networked micro labs, focused on topics of deep inquiry, need not have dozens of participants sitting in the same room. A team of participants with the necessary skills might be distributed among several institutions, several countries, networked digitally and through ongoing academic relationships…Because they are networked, a single micro-lab’s reach extends beyond the team itself or the duration of a specific project. When the opportunity arises, these micro-labs can coalesce into one larger lab with tremendous diversity and richness of talent. Breaking apart again, they may redistribute talent and resources. Analogous to the way ‘process networks’ mobilize highly specialized small companies across an extended integrated design and manufacturing process, a network of micro-labs creates a horizontal rhizomic structure in which the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts. The networked micro-lab can adapt to new questions and opportunities from outside as well as inside the network. <em>(Pendleton-Jullian, 2009)</em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Micro-labs are a simple and efficient mechanism for providing students informal learning opportunities in niches of their choices.</p>\\n<p>In a micro-labs course, student teams outline a plan of study and learning deliverables with the help of an instructor. Each study is completed over the period of 2-6 weeks. Coached by an instructor, students utilize any content they wish, including Open Educational Resources, to learn material in an authentic learning environment (Herrington &amp; Oliver, 2000). The learning outcomes consist of deliverables, which are typically given to the community, including blog posts, tutorials, software tools, and conference presentations.</p>\\n<p>Micro-labs courses promise many benefits. In some universities 50 percent of enrollment is concentrated in only 25 of the largest classes (Graham &amp; Stacey, 2002). This suggests the high financial cost of serving students in smaller niche classes, which can be reduced through the use of micro-labs courses as one teacher can coach significantly more student-led learning teams and less building resources are needed. Self-adaptive learning benefits students as they are able to learn the material in the manner, and with the resources of their choice. Students are also able to learn from and contribute to a community of practice in which they may later be employed. In addition, micro-labs courses better prepare students for today’s highly competitive and rapidly changing workplace, as they develop experience in directing their own learning.</p>\\n<h3>Micro-labs as a Class</h3>\\n<p>A normal class defines both the required learning outcomes and the required inputs (the homework, projects, group assignments etc.) that students must experience in order to (hopefully) arrive at the required outcomes. In other words, the professor decides, not only <em>what</em> the students should learn but also <em>how</em> they should learn.</p>\\n<p>This factory model for education is growing increasingly untenable as the world grows more complex. Today’s students graduate into a world of far greater uncertainty and far greater diversity as the formerly monolithic landscape dominated by a few large companies grows increasing fragmented and diversified. Our universities must help prepare students for many more types of career paths.</p>\\n<p>The core idea is that micro-lab classes adapts to its learners instead of requiring its learners to adapt to the class. This is the central idea of many web 2.0 applications. Services such as Twitter and Flickr provide simple mechanisms that users can apply to meet a large number of needs. In a similar way, the micro-lab course provides an architecture for students to build learning communities and use learning objects of their choosing.</p>\\n<p>Another model that’s helpful in understanding micro-lab classes is supply-push vs. demand-pull. Supply-push describes the traditional curriculum model, where faculty plan their courses to push knowledge to students through means such as textbooks or lectures. Demand-pull describes the type of learning typically done by extracurricular learners. For example, a person desiring more knowledge (demand) about RFID tags might search the Internet and pull information from various web pages.</p>\\n<p>A micro-lab class is a demand-pull not supply-push type class. Students decide what they want to learn and pull in content as needed and ask questions to different learning communities as needed. Supply-push models work best when resources are scarce, such as when professors are the sole source of information. Demand-pull models seem best when resources are abundant. Today’s Internet provides a tidal wave of information that learners can access.</p>\\n<p>Brown and Adler state:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The demand-pull approach is based on providing students with access to rich (sometimes virtual) learning communities built around a practice. It is passion-based learning, motivated by the student either wanting to become a member of a particular community of practice or just wanting to learn about, make, or perform something. Often the learning that transpires is informal rather than formally conducted in a structured setting. Learning occurs in part through a form of reflective practicum, but in this case the reflection comes from being embedded in a community of practice that may be supported by both a physical and a virtual presence and by collaboration between newcomers and professional practitioners/scholars.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In my next post, I’ll describe a micro-lab class we ran at BYU.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 485 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"How we ran a micro-lab course\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"social learning\",\"micro-labs\",\"connectivism\"],\"date\":\"2009-10-30T16:26:04.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>This is the second part of a (most likely) three-part series of posts I’m harvesting from a journal article Tim Olsen and I wrote earlier this year. You might want to read the first post for context, <a href=\\\"/organizing-university-learning-moving-beyond-classroom\\\">Organizing University Learning: Moving Beyond the Course to Micro-labs</a>, before continuing here.</p>\\n<p>This post is taken from the section of the paper where we describe our experience running a micro-lab course (with <a href=\\\"http://warp.byu.edu/site/\\\">Conan Albrecht</a> as the head teacher) in the <a href=\\\"http://marriottschool.byu.edu/bsisys/\\\">Information Systems department</a> at <a href=\\\"http://byu.edu\\\">BYU</a>.</p>\\n<p>First a review of the micro labs concept taken from the <a href=\\\"/organizing-university-learning-moving-beyond-classroom\\\">first post</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Micro-labs are small learning communities centered around answering a question, not mastering standardized content/skills</p>\\n<p>Micro-labs are a proposed university course architecture which supports and incorporates “web 2.0” informal learning principles, enabling students to entirely create their own curriculum with the goal of contributing all objects created by learning back to a learning community of practice, and an Internet audience. This course design seeks to harness both the student’s natural (intrinsic) desire to learn and the ease of access to knowledge created by advances in communication technologies.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In our micro-lab course, the students were asked to do four projects through the course of the semester. Each project had four steps. Students 1) create and post on the class website a learning contract specifying what they wish to learn, their process for learning, and planned deliverables. This contract is 2) revised with feedback from the instructor and fellow students. Students 3) complete the proposed learning contract and 4) share the completed deliverables by posting them to the class website and delivering an ignite-style presentation to the class (and if you’re curious, all learning contracts, project deliverables, and public discussion can be see on the <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/unclass/content/winter-2009-projects\\\">class website</a>).</p>\\n<h2>1. Formation of Learning Contract</h2>\\n<p>The project proposals were written by a student or a group of students, and defines what they wish to learn during the 3-4 week period of each project. Proposals can be a “learning project”, where students research a topic and write up a report, or a “building project”, where the student defines what they will create. Examples of learning projects include a <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/unclass/wiki/jee5-learning-write\\\">report on Java Enterprise Edition 5</a>, or <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/cloud-computing/wiki/amazon-web-services-overview\\\">wiki pages describing Amazon web services.</a> Building projects include making an <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/unclass/content/android-web-service-app-my-weather-running-and-full-source-code\\\">Android application</a>, a <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/unclass/wiki/visual-lyrics-phase-2\\\">lyrics visualization plug-in for iTunes</a>, or an <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/unclass/wiki/text-messaging-sms-gateway-interactivity\\\">SMS gateway</a>. During the last week of each project, students start to prepare learning contracts for the next iteration.</p>\\n<p>An obvious feature of the learning contract is that it is written entirely by the student. This allows for intrinsic motivation, as is illustrated in this student quote: “I was able to learn a lot about and use a bunch of technologies that I never would have been able to otherwise. I feel like I learned more than in a normal class, and because I got to choose what I wanted to learn, I would usually have trouble putting down my unclass project work to take care of my other homework.”</p>\\n<p>The ambiguous nature of how much work should go into a contract was a source of frustration for students. One student describes the initial disorganization and lack of set expectation: “We didn’t have any initial standard to set our projects to. I wasn’t sure if I had to build something huge to be considered complete, and I wasn’t sure what was expected of the presentations. I chalk all of that up to a learning experience though. I wasn’t given a ceiling so I was inclined to take my projects as far as I could, primarily because they were fun.” This quote raises an interesting research question: If students (instead of teachers) are allowed to set a learning contract for a course, are the students more ambitious?</p>\\n<h2>2. Students Incorporate Feedback into Proposals.</h2>\\n<p>Students post their learning contract to the class website to elicit feedback from the instructor and other students. This enables other students to see and learn from the feedback from the instructor. It also allows for the possible recruitment of other students to participate in the learning project. Once the contract is revised, the instructor approves the project and the students’ grade is bound to the satisfactory completion of the project.</p>\\n<h2>3. Contract fulfillment</h2>\\n<p>Students work individually or in teams to complete their learning contracts. They are challenged with the task of finding their own learning resources, and may ask the instructor and other students for direction. This is seen as a key feature of the design. As students find their own learning resources they are able to select resources which they find most helpful. Research suggests that students and experts possess different cognitive structures (Ericsson, Charness, Feltovich, &amp; Robert R. Hoffman, 2006). Experts are able compare a new situation to what they have experienced before through pattern recognition and are then able to recognize nuances and focus on important, rather than unessential elements.</p>\\n<p>Novices do not yet have a rich experience base, and as such learning is sequential (R. R. Hoffman, Shadbolt, Burton, &amp; Klein, 1995). We suggest that as students possess similar cognitive architectures they are better able to relate to novices in their class and outside of their class. As the process of learning becomes “transparent” and open through the use of technology students are able to use resources created by other novices to grapple with new subjects.</p>\\n<h3>What resources did the students use?</h3>\\n<p>If, as we suggest, students are better able to learn from learning objects created by novices (instead of experts), allowing the students to incorporate and find their own learning objects is a logical design for a course. Yet, from our experience, doing this can be very difficult for teachers. Data from the students gave surprising results on what resources were used to complete projects, and how they were found.</p>\\n<p>We were surprised by how many students used social networks to find learning resources. One student remarked, “Usually I would just start on a project, and when I came to the parts I didn’t know as much about I would search using Google and talk to friends who I thought might be knowledgeable on the subject.” As the course progressed student’s utilized the social network created through the class blog and wiki which was used to share knowledge that students had developed through the course of completing projects. This is illustrated through the following student comment.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>It was very helpful to use island and the respective blogs resulting from other student’s completed projects as a resource for my projects. I could remember certain things that the other class members were doing from their projects and ask them questions via instant messaging or island [the course website]. Because the class members took ownership of their projects I found them all to be very knowledgeable about the subjects they studied. This helped build a very nice knowledge base.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Another student mentioned other professors and students as well as people he had met on the internet through blogs as means through which he found educational resources. Most students mentioned that they contributed to the class blog as well as other students blogs, or their own blogs.</p>\\n<h2>4. Share learning deliverable</h2>\\n<p>Student’s share what they learn in two ways. First they post it on the course website so that other students can read and comment on it. Second, they create an “ignite presentation” which consists of a 5 minute power point presentation of 20 slides in which the slides automatically advance every 15 seconds. This is intended to be a rapid way of transmitting ideas in an engaging and entertaining manner.</p>\\n<p>By making the student learning deliverables available publicly on the Internet, it encourages student accountability for learning and creates learning objects that classmates and future students can access and build upon for their learning projects. These public traces of work are also useful as mentioned because students, by seeing what other students are working on, learn which students are expert in what and are able to use them as learning resources for those subjects. Another advantage is it helps market the class, major, and university to current and potential students. As these future students come to explore the college or university they will be able to “lurk” and see the projects and potential colleagues which they would be working with.</p>\\n<h2>Assessment</h2>\\n<p>Given the unusual nature of the class, assessment was handled differently. The majority (70%) of the points came from completely the contract as agreed upon in the learning contract. The remainder of the points were awarded for either extra work done on projects or where students helped other students in some way. This following is <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/unclass/wiki/unclasssyllabus\\\">the assessment portion of the class syllabus</a>:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>70% of your grade will come from the completion of your project. Items to be graded include:</li>\\n<li>Complete a contract that lists the work to be done (or learning to be achieved), the specific tasks or responsibilities of each student in the group, and any deliverables to be created.</li>\\n<li>Complete an appropriately difficult project meeting the contract agreed upon</li>\\n<li>Submit weekly progress updates</li>\\n<li>Attendance at weekly group meetings</li>\\n<li>Give an ignite presentation</li>\\n<li>Attend and present at least one session at the twice per semester unconference</li>\\n<li>20% of your grade will come from Learning 2.0 points. These include things such as:</li>\\n<li>Reviewing and making comments on other students’ contracts</li>\\n<li>Stories or blog posts to your project Island group</li>\\n<li>Comments made on other users’ stories, blog posts, and comments</li>\\n<li>Other indicators of interactions and work</li>\\n<li>10% of your grade will come from Friend points.</li>\\n<li>These are points that others can give to you (the student). They are totally at the discretion of the owner of the points. The teacher has a number of friend points he can assign, and each student has friend points he or she can give. Each student will be given 10 friends points per project. These points must be given to other students during the project or they are lost.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Two students mentioned that the grading procedure was the worst part of the class: “There was no fair assessment of the work we did.” “The [biggest problem with the course] was trying to figure out a grading metric for the class.”</p>\\n<p>As this was our first time involved with this type of course, we were unsure what would unfold. We were pleased to watch the class become a success, and see self-directed learning, and peer-teaching. Strong connections quickly formed between students which enabling them to access learning resources found throughout the community. We’re sure our course design could be significantly improved but we are thrilled it was successful as it was.</p>\\n<p>Ericsson, K. A., Charness, N., Feltovich, P. J., &amp; Hoffman, R. R. (2006).

It’s an incredibly dense read but so far my efforts have been richly rewarded.</p>\\n<p>I haven’t read enough of the book yet to feel up to writing a proper review/analysis but I wanted to pass along a bit from the introduction to the paperback edition that McLuhan wrote on education as the analysis (~50 years after it was written!) is still spot on and entirely appropriate to our discussions today on what education should become in the 21st century.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Any new technology gradually creates a totally new human environment. Environments are not passive wrappings but active processes. In his splendid work <em><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Preface-Plato-History-Greek-Mind/dp/0674699068\\\">Preface to Plato</a></em> (Harvard University Press, 1963), Eric Havelock contrasts the oral and written cultures of the Greeks. By Plato’s time the written word had created a new environment that had begun to detribalize man. Previously the Greeks had grown up by benefit of the process of the tribal encyclopedia. They had memorized the poets. The poets provided specific operational wisdom for all the contingencies of life–Ann Landers in verse. With the advent of individualized man, a new education was needed. Plato devised such a new program for literate men. It was based on the Ideas. With the phonetic alphabet, classified wisdom took over from the operational wisdom of Homer and Hesiod and the tribal encyclopedia. Education by classified data has been the Western program ever since.</p>\\n<p>Now, however, in the electronic age, data classification yields to pattern recognition, the key phrase at IBM. When data move instantly, classification is too fragmentary. In order to cope with data a electric speed in typical situations of “information overload,” men resort to the study of configurations, like the sailor in <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Descent_into_the_Maelstr%C3%B6m\\\">Edgar Allan Poe’s <em>Maelstrom</em></a>. The drop-out situation in our schools at present has only begun to develop. The young student today grows up in an electrically configured world. It is a world not of wheels but of circuits, not of fragments but of integral patterns. The student today <em>lives</em> mythically and in depth. At school, however, he encounters a situation organized by means of classified information. The subjects are unrelated. They are visually conceived in terms of a blueprint. The student can find no possible means of involvement for himself, nor can he discover how the educational scene relates to the “mythic” world of electronically processed data and experience that he takes for granted. As one IBM executive puts it, “My children had lived several lifetimes compared to their grandparents when they begun grade one.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>His definition of “myth” is necessary to understand the above quote. Taken from pg. 25 of the paperback version:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Myth is the instant vision of a complex process that ordinarily extends over a long period. Myth is contraction or implosion of any process, and the instant speed of electricity confers the mythic dimension on ordinary industrial and social action today.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Later in the book McLuhan writes that, “We <em>live</em> mythically but continue to think fragmentarily and on single planes.” The new electronic/internet environment we live in has reshaped how we live, learn, and work. The disconnect McLuhan identified between how we live and learn <em>outside</em> of school vs. <em>inside</em> of school has only grown since the 1960s.</p>\\n<p>Much of what passes for educational best practices these days are merely vestiges of a bygone era. For better or for worse, the electronic age has radically reshaped human thought and behavior. Clinging to educational practices designed to teach “data classification” helps no one – especially the students who are facing a world radically different than the one our schools prepare them for.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 487 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Three adoption patterns for educational social software\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"elearning2.0\",\"enterprise2.0\",\"Learning\",\"social software\",\"organizational behavior\",\"micro-labs\"],\"date\":\"2009-11-18T19:55:21.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I’ve been reading and thinking a lot lately about how to drive more adoption of the social learning platform I’m building here at BYU, <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu\\\">https://island.byu.edu</a>, and wanted to summarize some of the highlights of what I’ve learned. All of the patterns come directly from <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/\\\">Ross Mayfield</a> and <a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/\\\">Michael Idinopulos’s</a> writings so a big shout out to the great work they’re doing at <a href=\\\"http://www.socialtext.com/\\\">Socialtext</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Pattern 1: Launch Broad then Deep</h2>\\n<p>I wrote extensively about this pattern about a month ago in my post <a href=\\\"/deploying-social-software-universities-broad-then-deep\\\">Deploying Social Software in Universities: Go Broad then Deep</a>. The crux of the argument is that when deploying social software, you should first aim to get wide adoption, sign up as many people as possible, before trying to facilitate deeper, more complex engagement between your users. Social software without people is useless or as <a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/08/enterprise-20-skip-the-pilot.html\\\">Michael Idinopulos puts it</a>, “Scale is the oxygen that feeds collaboration.” In the competitive web2.0 world, the simplest tool almost always will win.</p>\\n<p>Once you’ve achieved broad adoption, the next step is to go deep. To quote Michael again, “[after achieving scale] deliver deep value by following up with local champions [deans, teachers, students] who want to invest time and effort in more robust, group-specific forms of collaboration.”</p>\\n<p>So launch simply and broadly. Let students and teachers adjust to having a web-enabled learning environment. Then go deep by building into the social learning platform higher-value tools such as blogs, wikis, and other collaborative learning tools and workflows.</p>\\n<h2>Pattern 2: Help Learners Climb the Participation Curve</h2>\\n<p>Ross Mayfield came up with a beautiful concept a number of years ago called the “<a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2006/04/power_law_of_pa.html\\\">Power Law of Participation</a>”</p>\\n<p>Reproduced image:</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/09/launching-at-scale-.html\\\"><img src=\\\"./power-law-participation.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>The essence of the model is that in any community, the vast majority of the members will not have a very high level of engagement with the community. For example, in most classes there will be a few students who actively participate while the rest play solitaire. When you first deploy social learning software, most learners will only participate by reading. While they do get value from reading and lurking in communities, learners will benefit even more if they move up the participation curve and engage more deeply in some of the communities they participate in.</p>\\n<p>Software adoption can be thought of in two dimensions, broad and deep. If your learners are successfully engaging in higher value / engagement tasks on your site, this deep adoption is occurring.</p>\\n<h2>Pattern 3: Focus on Creating Value</h2>\\n<p>It’s far to easy to focus on the tools we use rather than the value we’re trying to create (See Jon Mott’s blog, “<a href=\\\"http://www.jonmott.com/blog/2008/06/beginning-with-the-end-in-mind/\\\">The End in Mind</a>” for an extended discussion on this subject). Adoption will increase if we focus on more creating value (<a href=\\\"http://www.globalnerdy.com/2009/10/17/its-about-helping-your-users-become-awesome-or-being-better-is-better-by-kathy-sierra/\\\">making our users awesome</a>) and less on the specific tools we are building/using.</p>\\n<p>A social learning platform can add value to educational institutions in four contexts (See Michael’s post <a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/04/the-social-software-value-matrix.html\\\">The Social Software Value Matrix</a> for more):</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Within the classroom</li>\\n<li>Within departments</li>\\n<li>Within the institution</li>\\n<li>Across multiple institutions</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Socialtext recently released a white paper on the <a href=\\\"http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:vxa4yzS7cNcJ:www.socialtext.com/documents/wp_6WaystoGetBusinessValuefromSocialSoftware.pdf+formal+informal+socialtext&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;sig=AFQjCNFjnMdK1kI1rm0w-XW6Vxx0WlzFYQ\\\">6 Ways to Get Business Value from Social Software</a>. They discuss there how social software can greatly improve the formal and informal processes in each of the contexts that social software operates in.</p>\\n<p>Formal processes they define as “those things your organization does on a repeated basis.”</p>\\n<p>In an educational environment those would be things such as lectures, quizzes, studying, group projects, writing essays, exams, and so forth.</p>\\n<p>Informal processes they define as “all the many interactions that take place outside of this [formal] structure. They are not predictable and repeated, and therefore cannot be codified and defined… Informal processes make up the bulk of [learners] interactions.”</p>\\n<p>In an educational environment informal processes would include such activities as informal study groups, conversations in hallways, individuals or small groups meeting with professors or TAs, forums, clubs, and so forth.</p>\\n<p>Within an educational institutions there are many formal and informal learning processes that can be improved. As we focus on identifying poor processes and creating learning tools that clearly improve them, adoption of our social learning software will increase.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 488 */\n373,\n/* 489 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"McLuhan predicts newspaper's demise in 1965.\",\"tags\":[\"newspapers\"],\"date\":\"2009-12-19T20:29:17.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Reading through “<a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Media-Extensions-Marshall-McLuhan/dp/0262631598\\\">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</a>” by Marshall McLuhan, I came across this gem of a quote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The classified ads (and stock-market quotations) are the bedrock of the press.

I’ll be preparing an initial release over the next couple of weeks.</p>\\n<p>Also, if you do <strong>Drupal consulting in higher education</strong>, I’d love to work with you. <a href=\\\"mailto:mathews.kyle@gmail.com\\\">Please contact me</a> and let’s discuss how we can work together.</p>\\n<p>Lastly, if you’re an <strong>educator working in higher ed</strong>, I’d love to talk to you as well. Especially people working at online or virtual colleges and community colleges. If there’s an educational tool you’ve dreamed of having – or tried building and failed – <a href=\\\"mailto:mathews.kyle@gmail.com\\\">contact me</a> and tell me about it and I might just build it for you.</p>\\n<p>And if you’re not in one of the above three groups but know someone who is – please connect me with those people.</p>\\n<p>I’ll be doing a bit of travel in a couple of weeks. I’ll be in Boston February 17th-20th, New York February 22-23 and Washington DC on the 24th-25th. If you’re in one of those cities and want to meet and talk Drupal/higher education, let’s get in touch!</p>\\n<p>Thanks all! It’s going to be an exciting ride and I’m looking forward to it.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 492 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"My social learning Drupal distribution Eduglu is out for testing\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"Education\",\"Learning\",\"social learning\",\"Eduglu\"],\"date\":\"2010-03-22T20:19:25.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>The first alpha of Eduglu is out and ready for testing.

Eduglu is a partial-implementation of my vision of what an Drupal education distro should be. But I’m well aware that my vision is limited in many ways and that the problems I’ve designed Eduglu to solve probably don’t even begin to cover all the different problems you as a collective are trying to solve.</p>\\n<p>So let’s get the conversation going. What do you think Eduglu should be? What problems are you facing? What would your dream social learning website be? If you’re building some sort of social learning tool on Drupal already (as I know many of you are), what are you trying to do and how?</p>\\n<p>So this first alpha is a chance for us to talk about what Eduglu should be. Once we’ve decided what Eduglu should be, we can start pushing toward a stable Beta release, fixing bugs and adding missing features.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://community.eduglu.org\\\">Let’s get started!</a></p>\\n<h2>Screencast of installation and initial setup of Eduglu</h2>\\n<p>\\n  <object width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"525\\\"><param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/v/-5SLfDKxTi8&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&hd=1&border=1\\\"></param><param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\"></param><param name=\\\"allowscriptaccess\\\" value=\\\"always\\\"></param><embed src=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/v/-5SLfDKxTi8&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0&hd=1&border=1\\\" type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" allowscriptaccess=\\\"always\\\" allowfullscreen=\\\"true\\\" width=\\\"660\\\" height=\\\"525\\\"></embed></object>\\n</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 493 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Notes from \\\"The Future of Teaching & Learning\\\" conference — Howard Rheingold's keynote\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"Eduglu\",\"future of learning\",\"teaching\",\"socialmediaclassroom\"],\"date\":\"2010-04-17T17:04:24.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>First Keynote from Howard Rheingold.</p>\\n<p>Started teaching a digital journalism class then moved on to teaching digital literacy. When first started teaching classrooms, thought about how to use online media to overcome disadvantages of teaching in classrooms namely a) not all teachers good at speaking extemporously and b) classroom learning militates against thoughtfulness, can’t share thought that occurs an hour after class.</p>\\n<p>First started experimenting with using online tools for learning in 1995.</p>\\n<p>When first started teaching in 2005? Used wikis from one tool, forums from another, blogs from another. Immediate feedback from students was this was too complex. So thought about consolidating tools. Entered Haystack competition and won some money to create the <a href=\\\"http://socialmediaclassroom.com\\\">socialmediaclassroom.com</a>.</p>\\n<p>Socialmediaclassroom tool is freely downloadable or you can ask for hosted version. He’s developed a number of lesson plans for introducing participatory media to students.</p>\\n<p>Developed way within Drupal to tie all work done around a lecture to be listed on page.</p>\\n<p>Says forums not used as much as 10-15 years ago.</p>\\n<p>Unique accordance of forums – long-lasting conversations on topics. Help students get to know each other. Continue classroom discussions asynchronously online.</p>\\n<p>Introducing other features of socialmediaclassroom – blogs w/ rich media, group chat, syllabus in the wiki, social bookmarking (which is new to a lot of students) – use to collect resources for class project. Depending on class, sends students to delicious or diigo for discovery of different resources.</p>\\n<p>Has found that moving classroom chairs into a circle resulting in increase in classroom conversation.</p>\\n<p>Has co-teaching teams made up of students. He asks them to lists concepts and terms talked about in each class. Then other classmates fill out the descriptions.</p>\\n<p>Surprised at how <em>illiterate</em> most students were when he started teaching college students.</p>\\n<p>Essence of what skills needs to teach children – How can you find the answer to any question? How do you know that what you find is accurate?</p>\\n<p>Example he uses – if do search for “martin luther king jr” The 8th result is from <a href=\\\"http://martinlutherking.org\\\">martinlutherking.org</a> – which is a website slamming on MLK. Used <a href=\\\"http://whoisit.com\\\">whoisit.com</a> to find <a href=\\\"http://martinlutherking.org\\\">martinlutherking.org</a> owned by white nationalist site Stormfront.</p>\\n<p>Seems clear that youth are moving from passive consumption to active participation. Youth can create as well as consume online.</p>\\n<p>Gave a number of examples of how students are using social tools to help organize collective action.</p>\\n<p>We need to look at network theory, sociology research, network literacies, media theory as we redesign education for the digital age.</p>\\n<p>Don’t just pay attention to technology, also pay attention to literacies.</p>\\n<p>Social medias are not always appropriate to teaching</p>\\n<p>Not add ons, essential elements of student’s lives of today and tomorrow.

Eduglu is a Drupal distribution designed to support social learning at institutions of higher learning. It’s available for download now at <a href=\\\"http://eduglu.com/download-eduglu\\\">http://eduglu.com/download-eduglu</a>. Since the first release, We’ve squashed dozens of major and minor bugs and made the significant jump to the <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/spaces\\\">Spaces 3</a> and <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/context\\\">Context 3</a>.</p>\\n<p>Eduglu helps learners connect with one another and form learning communities.

Schools and other organizations will soon be able to easily sign-up for hosted Eduglu to meet the social learning needs of their organization. Head over to <a href=\\\"http://eduglu.com\\\">eduglu.com</a> and leave your email address to hear when we open up for business and to provide early feedback.</p>\\n<p>This will be our initial stab at creating a <a href=\\\"http://buytaert.net/on-business-models-for-drupal-distributions\\\">sustainable business model for our Drupal educational distribution</a>. There’s been <a href=\\\"http://acquia.com/blog/drupal-software-publishing\\\">a</a> <a href=\\\"http://buytaert.net/on-business-models-for-drupal-distributions\\\">lot</a> <a href=\\\"http://developmentseed.org/blog/2010/mar/13/ideas-open-atrium-partners-program\\\">of</a> discussion <a href=\\\"http://www.agileapproach.com/blog-entry/openpublish-20-and-beyond-labor-love-1\\\">lately</a> in the Drupal community about finding business models that can help create sustainable Drupal Distributions. I’m not sure hosted Eduglu is the right business model for that task but since a startup is “<a href=\\\"http://steveblank.com/2010/04/12/why-startups-are-agile-and-opportunistic-%E2%80%93-pivoting-the-business-model/\\\">an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model</a>”, we’ll give this business model a try for awhile as we look for ways to freshen the stagnant world of educational technology.</p>\\n<h3>What’s coming next for Eduglu?</h3>\\n<p>Eduglu works well with 500-1000 members. But we want it to work for much much larger organizations. Organizations the size of my alma mater Brigham Young University that has 30,000 students and 250,000+ alumni. To make Eduglu work on that scale, we’ll be adding features such as group suggesting, robust search and filtering, activity streams, and twitter-style following.</p>\\n<p>Also we’re working on a number of social learning applications. Right now Eduglu ships with four social learning applications. A discussion/mailing list, wiki, and polling.</p>\\n<p>The next two major applications we’d like to ship are a blogging application that let’s learners blog on various things they are learning and comment on other’s blogs. If the learner has an existing blog, they’ll be able to connect it to their Eduglu blog so new posts there are automatically imported.</p>\\n<p>The second application is a Group RSS Reader that lets a group of learners subscribe to content via RSS and provides various means for rating, sorting, sharing, and discussing content brought into the group.</p>\\n<p>Both are powerful learning tools that help students more easily share what they are learning and track and discuss the best ideas that are being written about on the Internet and we’re excited to get them out into the wild.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 497 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"The problem of too general tools\",\"tags\":[\"entrepreneurship\"],\"date\":\"2010-06-02T19:49:23.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"readNext\":\"/how-design-social-networking-site-using-social-objects/\",\"body\":\"<p>There was a nugget of a comment today on the Lean Startup Circle from William Pietri:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>However, having made the mistake of building too-general tools before, let me offer a bit of advice. Tools may be general, but people only have specific problems. So if you want an individual to choose to use your software, you have to solve their specific problem well. Generality is a consequence of extracting the similar bits of specific problems, not a goal on its own (however much that appeals to gadget nerds and toolbuilders like us). Real users mainly appreciate that generality later, if they ever do, when they have a second specific problem that is now easier to solve because they’re familiar with your tool.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>It struck me because I’m slowly starting to see this is part of the problem I’m facing with my educational tool, <a href=\\\"http://eduglu.com\\\">Eduglu</a>. Right now I pitch Eduglu as a “social learning platform” that includes a number of learning tools out of the box and can easily be extended to meet specific needs of the learning organization that adopts it. But when I pitch, I don’t seem to be moving anyone. It seems my pitch is falling into the too-general tool trap that William warned against. Yes, an adopting organization can use it for all sorts of things, eventually, but people don’t buy things to solve “all sorts of things”. They buy things to meet very specific needs.</p>\\n<p>Or as Sean Murphy put it in another thread, narrower focus &amp; deeper pain is better.</p>\\n<p>The hardest part of starting a company I think is learning to understand how others think and feel about something. As a toolbuilder, I’m very used to evaluating generic tools and understanding how to apply them to solve my specific problems. But most people aren’t as adept at that art. I need to understand how to get inside people’s heads and intimately understand what they need and the learn to present what I’m building in a way that it will be obvious to them how my tool will solve their problems.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 498 */\n373,\n/* 499 */\n373,\n/* 500 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Three worldwide education trends behind Eduglu\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"elearning2.0\",\"Learning\",\"Eduglu\",\"launchup\"],\"date\":\"2010-08-31T22:01:23.000Z\",\"draft\":true,\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Later this week, I’ll be presenting on my company <a href=\\\"http://eduglu.com\\\">Eduglu</a> and product <a href=\\\"http://eduglu.com/download-eduglu\\\">Eduglu</a> at <a href=\\\"http://www.launchup.org/2010/08/31/eduglu-qa/\\\">Launchup</a>, a local entrepreneurship event. In preparing for my presentation, I’ve stepped back again and revisited my reasons for why I started Eduglu and why I think it’s needed.</p>\\n<p>I see three trends which are starting to dramatically change how we learn and how that learning happens.</p>\\n<h3>The changing nature of learning</h3>\\n<p>Today’s educational system was designed when the expectation was that for most people, what they learned in school was sufficient to make them good employees for the remainder of their working career. If you started as an accountant in 1860 and retired 40 years later, at the end of your career you could expect that most of the knowledge you learned in school was still useful.</p>\\n<p>Today, that is very much not the case. Knowledge is growing exponentially and the “<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life_of_knowledge\\\">half-life</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/connectivism.htm\\\">of knowledge</a>” has shrunken dramatically. Whereas 100 years ago, one large investment of schooling at the beginning of our lives was enough to last an entire career, now we need to getting smaller chunks of schooling throughout our lives. We’ll continually transition between investing in learning and harvesting the rewards of those learnings.</p>\\n<p>[Graph from “<a href=\\\"http://blog.trailmeme.com/2010/06/the-emerging-principles-of-lifelong-learning/\\\">The Emerging Principles of Lifelong Learning</a>” by <a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/vgr\\\">@vgr</a>]</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./lifelongLearning.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>An example of this I recently came across. I was talking to a client of mine about the industry they work in, <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_classification\\\">medical insurance coding.</a> Coding is the process of transforming a doctor’s description of a medical visit into universal medical code numbers. My client who provide a number of training courses on doing coding, were telling me about the coming change in United States from the international coding standard ICD9 to ICD-10. An enormous number of people involved with coding will need to receive new training to learn the new standards.</p>\\n<p>This is a great example of what is happening because of the shortened half-life of knowledge. Our knowledge is increasing rapidly about the human body and how to treat its problems. Because of this growth in knowledge, standards about how to describe diagnosis and procedures became outdated and were revised. Because of this coming shift to new coding standards, many people will need new training.</p>\\n<p>This same pattern is repeating across dozens of industries. Supporting this sorts of short semi-continuous online classes is a major focus for Eduglu.</p>\\n<h3>Higher Ed Bubble</h3>\\n<p>The current educational system is unsustainable and needs a pruning. It’s a bubble fueled by cheap federal student loans and is perilously similar to the housing bubble we recently lived through.</p>\\n<p>I ran across <a href=\\\"http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2010/06/higher-education-bubble-its-about-to.html#\\\">these two graphs</a> today which illustrate the problem well:</p>\\n<p><strong>Housing bubble</strong></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./housing-bubble.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>Higher Ed Bubble</strong></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./highered-bubble.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>If <a href=\\\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columns/Sunday_Reflections/Higher-education_s-bubble-is-about-to-burst-95639354.html\\\">the bubble does pop</a> and students start to shy away from high priced colleges and look for cheaper alternatives, more and more will look towards the pioneering online schools who provide most of the value of traditional universities with far more flexibility and far less cost.</p>\\n<h3>Demand for higher education outgrowing ability to build new schools</h3>\\n<p>As the world becomes wealthier, 100s of millions of youth are beginning to demand access to higher education. In India alone, it was estimated that provide higher education to the same percentage the population as in United States, they would need to build nearly 2400 new universities in the next 25 years or roughly 2 per week.</p>\\n<p>Building that many schools is clearly impossible. Traditional face-to-face educational models can’t scale affordably to meet that sort of demand. New models need to be developed that can operate at the low costs and large scale required</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.col.org/resources/speeches/2007presentations/Pages/2007-massTertiaryEd.aspx\\\">http://www.col.org/resources/speeches/2007presentations/Pages/2007-massTertiaryEd.aspx</a></p>\\n<p>how to educate far more people for far less resources? 10x numbers of students for the same amount of resources?</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 501 */\n373,\n/* 502 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"First beta release for Drupal-native mailinglist module\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"drupal planet\",\"Eduglu\",\"OG Mailinglist\"],\"date\":\"2010-09-15T22:49:54.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Today I rolled out the first beta for my <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/og_mailinglist\\\">Drupal module, OG Mailinglist</a>, which provides native mailinglist functionality to Drupal similar to <a href=\\\"http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html\\\">Mailman</a> or <a href=\\\"http://groups.google.com\\\">Google Groups</a>.</p>\\n<p>OG Mailinglist provides complete email integration for Organic Group-based Drupal sites.

A great platform by itself isn’t that interesting or useful. It takes killer apps to attract customers and define the platform.</p>\\n<p>Since the computer industry hit its stride we’ve seen a number of examples of killer platforms and killer app duos. 1000s of financial workers bought the Apple II platform on the the strength of VisiCalc and Lotus 1-2-3. Once Facebook opened up their platform, 1000s of applications and services were written, most worthless, but social gaming company Zyanga has made 100s of millions of dollars from games like Farmville and Mafia Wars. Apple’s App Store has introduced millions to the “app lifestyle” through its various iOS devices.</p>\\n<p>In the world of the Drupal platform, many people think Drupal distros are becoming the “killer apps” of Drupal. They (and I) believe that these distros / applications will help Drupal attract new customers in new markets. Popular distros, such as <a href=\\\"http://openatrium.com\\\">Open Atrium</a> and <a href=\\\"http://openpublishapp.com/\\\">OpenPublish</a>, are starting to show that this model can work as they and other distros are receiving attention far outside the normal channels and communities which discuss Drupal.</p>\\n<p>For the past year or so, I’ve been working on building a Drupal distro called <a href=\\\"http://eduglu.com\\\">Eduglu</a>, which is a social learning product designed to support groups of learners. Similar to Drupal, my company’s product Eduglu is a platform. As part of developing the platform I’ve built a number of apps for it such as a forum/mailinglist, polls, etc.</p>\\n<p>But while these are nice apps and I’m really pleased about how the platform is coming together, I feel that Eduglu is still missing its set of killer apps.</p>\\n<p>Many people look at Eduglu now and think “meh”, “what does it do”, they ask, “that existing education / community platforms don’t already do?”</p>\\n<p>And… I can’t really answer that question. Not yet anyways. Eduglu is still missing its killer app that for 1000s of organizations will become <em>the</em> reason that they <em>must</em> adapt Eduglu as their learning platform. Something like email that for millions of companies and households was the “reason” they signed up for Internet.</p>\\n<p>So recently, I’ve made a prediction to myself, that Eduglu will become a success only if a large number of apps are built on top of the platform.</p>\\n<p>But luckily, I don’t have to rely entirely on people building apps specifically for Eduglu. In <a href=\\\"http://buytaert.net/\\\">Dries Buytaert’s</a> (founder of Drupal) <a href=\\\"http://buytaert.net/drupal-distributions\\\">first post on Drupal distributions</a> four years ago, he said that for Drupal distributions to succeed, they must collaborate not compete. That Drupal distros can’t fork Drupal core or otherwise introduce incompatibilities between themselves.</p>\\n<p>And happily, that is what has happened. Through the efforts of many in the Drupal community, particularly <a href=\\\"http://developmentseed.org/\\\">Development Seed</a>, it is possible to take an application written for one Drupal distro and reuse it across multiple other distros. And one very interesting effort, <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/debut\\\">Debut</a>, is working to build a common set of applications specifically designed to serve as base applications for a variety of Drupal distrubutions.</p>\\n<p>So this has left me, Eduglu, and other Drupal distros in a nice spot. Many people are working together to build reusable apps and Drupal, particularly with the upcoming Drupal 7 release, has developed into a very nice framework for building web applications.</p>\\n<p>So I have two items now on my roadmap for Eduglu.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Refine and evangelize the platform and</li>\\n<li>Develop killer apps.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>And while predicting in advance what is or isn’t a “killer app” is difficult, I have a few ideas up my sleeve. First on the list is a realtime notetaking app built with Drupal and <a href=\\\"http://etherpad.org\\\">Etherpad</a>. Students will be able to take notes together, attach audio recordings of the lecture and other media files, and save all of this to the class website where it’ll it can be referred to in the future.</p>\\n<p>And if you already know what you’re killer app for learning is and just need someone to build it then by all means, <a href=\\\"http://eduglu.com/contact\\\">please contact us!</a> We’d be happy to help :)</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 510 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Creating a CCK Field module with an \\\"invisible\\\" widget\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"drupal planet\",\"etherpad\",\"drupal modules\"],\"date\":\"2010-11-19T00:14:48.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Most CCK Field modules have a widget where the user adds information upon creating a node which is then saved with the node.

Generally you’ll just want to define your widget in hook_widgets.</p>\\n<p>Two really important things here to get your “invisible” widget to work correctly. First, you <strong>must</strong> name your form keys the same as you named your database column names in hook_field_settings. This tripped me up for a long time.

It synthesizes a shelf full or two of books but I’m finding its ideas a fertile source for new ways to think about decision making and the world in general.</p>\\n<p>The opening page of the book re-introduced me to a quote from Fredrick Neitzsche:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Lonely one, you are going the way to yourself. And your way leads past yourself and your seven devils. You will be a heretic to yourself and a witch and soothsayer and fool and doubter and unholy one and a villain. You must wish to consume yourself in your own flame: how could you wish to become new unless you had first become ashes!</p>\\n<p>Lonely one, you are going the way of the creator: you would create a god for yourself out of your seven devils.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>One last thought, also drawn from Tempo, on the tension between contemplation and action. Quoting now, “a tension that causes us to swing between a greedy, grasping engagement of life, and a tentative, doubting withdrawal from it. A mode of life that doubts the possibility of meaning sufficiently to choose action, and believes in the possibility sufficiently to be tempted into reflection.”</p>\\n<p>As I’ve grown older, and hopefully a bit more mature, it seems more and more of my thinking has started to center around the many paradoxical pairs of ideas such as this one and others such as reason vs. emotion, freedom vs. order, individual integrity vs. com­munity responsibility, men vs. women, justice vs. mercy, liberty vs. equity, etc.</p>\\n<p>It seems one or more of these paradoxical pairs of ideas is at the heart of every significant problem I face.</p>\\n<p>The contemplation/action pair is especially meaningful right now as I’m in the midst of a doubting withdrawal from life as I close up shop on my first startup and reflect on what to do next.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 515 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"New Drupal-Mixpanel integration module released to track event-based analytics\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"drupal planet\"],\"date\":\"2011-04-23T00:23:01.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>As part of my work with my (<a href=\\\"/eduglu-enters-deadpool\\\">now defunct</a>) startup Eduglu, I wrote a Drupal module that integrates with the popular analytics service Mixpanel.</p>\\n<p>Web analytics help you understand what visitors do on your website and what is working and what is not.

Our church doesn’t have paid ministry meaning everyone who attends occasionally takes their turn preaching and exhorting.</em></p>\\n<p>I’d like to share today some things that I’ve learned about developing faith.</p>\\n<p>When I arrived on my mission, I thought I understood faith much better than I did. I was soon humbled to learn, as I tried to teach people, that no, I really didn’t know much about faith. Now properly contrite, I began my study of faith.</p>\\n<p>I think my favorite definition of faith in God is to have confidence that the Lord will do what He says He’ll do. But while this sounds simple, in practice it’s quite difficult. To fully have faith in the Lord, it’s not enough to believe in the Lord, we must actually understand what He will do in different situations.</p>\\n<p>This is why, I think, there’s such a strong connection between studying the gospel, personal revelation, and faith. Because the more we learn about the gospel, the better we understand what God will do and the more we can rely up on Him. The less we understand about the Lord and His gospel the harder it is to have confidence in the Lord because we won’t know what He says He will do and when He does do something, we are completely befuddled as to why He did what He did.</p>\\n<p>So to me, confidence or faith in the Lord comes from knowing Him and understanding what He does and why He does what He does.</p>\\n<p>It’s like having a really good friend who you’ve known forever. You know each other so well that you know how they’ll act when they’re happy, sad, disappointed, hurt, etc. Whatever the situation, you can pretty well predict how they’ll act. And you’ve also learned you can rely on them to comfort you when sad, to listen to a story when something good happens happen, to give good council when you have a problem.</p>\\n<p>Developing faith in the Lord is much the same. As we get to know the Lord, understand His character, like that friend, we will soon be able to predict how the Lord will act given a certain situation. And the better we know the Lord, the better we will be able to predict what He will do and the more we can rely on Him. So in other words, understanding the Lord and having faith in the Lord is one and the same.</p>\\n<p>But for this to happen, we need to have personal experiences with the Lord. If a friend wants to introduce you to another friend and raves about how cool they are and how much you’ll like them, you’ll trust their opinion but only so much. You need to meet this new person yourself before you’ll fully believe that they are as cool as your friend says.</p>\\n<p>This is why I think that’s why scripture study and personal revelation are so important. Because without those things, we cannot understand God or why He does what He does. And without that understanding we cannot place full confidence in Him.</p>\\n<p>And not having that understanding can cause a lot of problems. I think a lot of the difficulties we face in life, particularly ones that challenge our faith, are the result of ignorance or misunderstandings about God.</p>\\n<p>For example, a trap I often fall into is I ask for blessings that the Lord doesn’t want to give me. I will pray with great sincerity for long periods of time and when the Lord finally convinces me the answer is no, I’m bitterly disappointed. If I’d understood better what the Lord wants to give me before I tried asking then I wouldn’t of been disappointed, or even surprised for that matter, when the Lord said no. I used to wander at how the <a href=\\\"http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/10?lang=eng#7\\\">Lord could promise certain prophets in the scriptures that whatever they asked for would be given them</a>. I don’t wander anymore because now it’s clear. The Lord could give them this power because He knew that these prophets understood Him and His plan so well that they would only ask for things He already intended to give them.</p>\\n<p>So all of us struggle at times with our faith in the Lord. How do we develop stronger faith in the Lord? I think the most straightforward answer to that question is simply, learn more about Him. Learn of His character. Learn of His promises. And learn about how and when He delivers on those promises.</p>\\n<p>Of course, doing this is easier said then done. I think this is the principle challenge of our life, learning about God and molding our lives after His.</p>\\n<p>I testify that the Lord cares very much that we understand Him correctly and He has given us many aids to learn of Him and He places experiences in our lives which, if we let them, will help us understand who He is and why He does what He does.</p>\\n<p>Now I want to share a few experiences where by learning more about the Lord, my faith was strengthened.</p>\\n<p>After spending the first part of my mission in the big city in Manila, I was transferred to a very rural farming area in Alfonso, Cavite, the province just south of Manila. After one transfer with my first companion there, I got a new companion and for the first time became a senior companion. And to be honest, I was kinda terrified. I didn’t have a lot of confidence yet in my Tagalog or in my abilities as a missionary but I really wanted to do a good job. And I was putting a lot of pressure on myself to measure up. Shortly after becoming a senior companion, I read a scripture which changed my mission and my life. It’s in <a href=\\\"http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6?lang=eng#33\\\">Doctrine and Covenants section 6 verse 34 and 36</a>. They read:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>34 Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail.</p>\\n<p>36 Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The effect of those scriptures on me was enormous. I realized much more clearly that I was on the Lord’s errand doing His will. And as long as I looked to the Lord in every thought and doubted not and feared not, He would guide, protect, and strengthen me enough to fulfill my duties as a missionary. After I read this, as we went around to our various appointments and some fear would come over me, I would repeat in my head over and over as a mantra of sorts, ‘‘look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not’’, and my fears would melt away.</p>\\n<p>My next experience was more recent. There was something I very much desired and wanted to pray to the Lord for His help in getting it. But for various reasons at the time I felt unworthy to ask, my imperfections and weaknesses seemed to be looming over me stronger than normal. About that time I read this from <a href=\\\"http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng\\\">Ether chapter 3 in the Book of Mormon</a>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>2 Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with thy servant because of his weakness before thee; for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are unworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures have become evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou has given us a commandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we many receive according to our desires.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>As the brother of Jared, I felt unworthy and somewhat evil at the time. But this scripture helped me realize that however unworthy I felt, I was compounding the problem by not praying for my desire. I realized that we don’t have to be perfect to be blessed by the Lord. I realized that no matter how unworthy or evil we think we are, the Lord still wants us to call on him. Because I understood this, my faith grew stronger that the Lord would bless me with the things I asked.</p>\\n<p>My last experience happened when I was suffering through a very difficult period of my life. There’s a story in the Book of Mormon I’ve always loved about the people led by Alma the Senior that broke away from King Noah and his people and established a new community. Soon however disaster struck and they were conquered and enslaved by a Lamenite army. I’ve always marveled at how well they stood up under this rather extreme trial. In <a href=\\\"http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24?lang=eng#14\\\">Mosiah 24:15</a> we read:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>15 And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and <em>they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.</em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I wandered how they were able to do that, ‘‘submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord’’ as I most certainly was not feeling the least bit cheerful and patient at the time. Were they some sort of super-spiritual humans that could perform great feats of self-control that I could never hope to?</p>\\n<p>But then the Spirit gently told me I was misreading the story. He directed my attention again to the <a href=\\\"http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24?lang=eng#13\\\">previous verse</a>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>14 And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>It wasn’t that these people were so special (though they were) that they were able to bear this trial with cheerfulness and patience, it was because the Lord blessed them that their burdens became light. The Spirit also directed me to <a href=\\\"http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/30?lang=eng\\\">Doctrine and Covenants 30:1</a>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>1 Behold, I say unto you, David, that you have feared man and <em>have not relied on me for strength as you ought.</em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I felt this chastisement also applied to me. I thought I had to endure the trouble I was facing by myself and was not relying on the Lord for strength as I ought. Humbled, I prayed that the Lord would strengthen me. From then on through the end of the experience, when the trouble threatened to overwhelm me, I would stop and pray, ‘‘Lord, I can’t do this by myself, please help me’’, and soon, I found that my burdens too became much easier to bear.</p>\\n<p>I testify that the Lord does exist. That He does love us. That He is merciful and kind and just. And that He can and will fulfill every promise He has made. And that as we learn of Him, learn of His will for us, and align our lives with His will, our confidence in Him will wax strong and we will be richly blessed all of our days.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 522 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"It is the learners who inherit the future\",\"tags\":null,\"date\":\"2011-07-25T04:59:38.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<blockquote>\\n<p>The central task of education is to implant a will and a facility for\\nlearning; it should produce not learned but learning people.

I’ve tried a good chunk of the GTD apps out there and have been dissatisfied with each of them for one reason or another.</p>\\n<h2>Motivations</h2>\\n<p>I have a few reasons for starting this project.</p>\\n<p>First is I really like the GTD system. When it’s running well, I really do feel more organized and able to focus on my priorities. But I’ve never been able to find a system that was maintainable long-term. I’ve tried many that worked for a time but each gradually required more and more effort to maintain until eventually I had to quit using them. I’ve thought a fair bit about why they’ve failed and I believe I can create an app that will actually work long-term.</p>\\n<p>My second motivation is there’s a number of really cool technologies I’d like to learn or practice with including Node.js, Coffeescript, Backbone.js, ElasticSearch, Responsive Design, AppCache, and LocalStorage–each of which I’ll be using to build SimpleGTD. It’s really hard to learn new skills outside of the context of working toward a concrete goal so a nice compact project like this is gold.</p>\\n<p>My third motivation is to keep my startup “muscles” strong. For a variety of reasons, I’m not interested in doing another startup right now. But I will in the future. I plan to offer hosting and support for SimpleGTD app (for those not wanting to host it themselves). Doing the marketing, handling payments, support issues, etc. will allow me to practice all the parts of running a “real” company without the stress of caring whether my micro-business actually succeeds.</p>\\n<p>I have a number of similar side projects planned or in progress that I’ll also be treating as micro-businesses. I’m building these projects primarily for myself but it’ll be fun to also put them out in the wild and see what happens.</p>\\n<h2>Key design principles</h2>\\n<h3>Fast</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://thinkvitamin.com/web-apps/fred-wilsons-10-golden-principles-of-successful-web-apps/\\\">To quote Fred Wilson</a>, “Speed is more than a feature. Speed is the most important feature. If your application is slow, people won’t use it.”</p>\\n<p>More than any other flaw, lack of speed is the reason I eventually have quit the software GTD apps I’ve tried. Paper is really fast. Compared to a piece of paper or sticky note sitting on your desk, it’s cumbersome to have to load a desktop or web app just to view your tasks.</p>\\n<p>To compete with paper, any software-based GTD system must load instantly and quickly show you exactly what you want.</p>\\n<p>Other actions, such as navigating, adding, and editing projects and actions must also be fast. My plan is that all movement within the application can be done via the keyboard, ala GMail.</p>\\n<p>To meet my speed standards, I’m going to use a variety of techniques. First all code and data will be stored locally using AppCache and LocalStorage. The app will load first from LocalStorage and only then sync with the server. This should solve much of the slow-start problem.</p>\\n<p>Second, I’ll build the app as a single-page app. All communication with the server will happen asynchronously. This means viewing a project page or adding a new task won’t require reloading the page so navigation within the app will be fast.</p>\\n<h3>Simple</h3>\\n<p>A big problem I’ve had with other systems I’ve tried is they’re too complex for my tastes. They try too hard. I don’t want to implement <a href=\\\"http://www.dragosroua.com/staying-gtd-over-the-hype/\\\">every idea David Allen has ever come up with</a>. All I want my GTD app to do is add projects, add action items to these projects, and easily choose and sort the actions that I’ll be working on the next day or two.</p>\\n<p>Paper-like simplicity is my goal here, not Microsoft Project.</p>\\n<h3>Built for the 21st century</h3>\\n<p>This is the 21st century. Almost everyone now is carrying around a smartphone in their pocket 24/7. No one prints off todos anymore. You should be able to select your action items for the day on your computer, walk out the door, open the app on your phone and instantly see what needs to be done.</p>\\n<h2>Built to forgive and protect</h2>\\n<p>The above ideas are fairly standard. My last idea is a bit more unique.</p>\\n<p>Keeping task lists is a hard discipline and <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/114723964985237592593/posts/hsVEEpov6Ti\\\">almost everyone fails at times</a>. Our tasks lists seem to quickly disintegrate into a disorganized, unwieldy mess without the occasional superhuman effort to clean things up. I’d like SimpleGTD to help us avoid that superhuman effort.</p>\\n<p>I think this is one reason I like paper. When a list of tasks on paper gets too overwhelming, you can just throw it away or bury it under other paper. Most GTD/Task software is less forgiving in this respect. If you add a project or task it’s there forever until you explicitly delete it.</p>\\n<p>The problem is our brains has a selective membrane of sorts for commitments. It requires little force to insert a commitment but quite a bit of force to remove it. We’re addicted to being “productive” and the rewards that come from completing tasks. With each added task, we imagine the praise we’ll get once we accomplish it. Each new task is a shot of dopamine. Deleting a task or project kills the hope for that future reward.</p>\\n<p>In my past forays with GTD software, I would cheerful add tasks and projects much faster than I could finish them. They would accumulate and accumulate until I dreaded even looking at the software with its long list of uncompleted tasks.</p>\\n<p>What we have is a garbage collection problem. We accumulate projects and tasks don’t throw out the ones we’ve abandoned. The garbage piles up higher and higher until eventually we have to abandon the house altogether and start a new one.</p>\\n<p>Like people portrayed on the TV show <a href=\\\"http://www.aetv.com/hoarders/about/\\\">Hoarders</a>, we find it difficult to throw away commitments.</p>\\n<p>I think the weekly review is what’s supposed to corral this problem but I’ve never been able to do one consistently – most likely because I dread having to decide what projects/tasks to abandon.</p>\\n<p>So what we need is to have the software help us to delete projects/tasks that we can’t accomplish. As I’ve proven many-a-time, I can’t manually keep my tasks lists in check. What we need I think is a Roomba-like garbage collector that detects dying projects and cleans them up for us.</p>\\n<p>But how to detect those projects/tasks that have gone stale–those projects/tasks that we’ve effectively abandoned but haven’t yet told our consciousness? How can the software pick up on our unconscious cues that a task or project should be removed?</p>\\n<p>The best way I’ve thought of so far is to track how often we look at something. If we’re actually working on a project or task, we’ll be viewing or editing it fairly often. When we start to abandon a project or task, we stop looking at it. The software will track each time a project or task is viewed. If enough time passes since the last time you viewed the project, it’ll be garbage collected and removed from active view. For tasks, they’ll be removed from the active task list. For projects, they’ll be moved to the someday/maybe list. And for projects already in the someday/maybe list, eventually they’ll be moved into an archived list.</p>\\n<p>On timing, my thinking is tasks get garbage collected after 24 hours, projects after two months, and someday/maybe projects after six months.</p>\\n<p>So if you want a task or project to disappear, just ignore it and it’ll eventually go away. Which follows our natural pattern. If we don’t want to do something, we stop thinking about and eventually forget it. Most software has the annoying property of never forgetting.</p>\\n<p>At the start of the week, your active todos list should be white and empty, waiting for you to select the weeks tasks. If you load up a number of tasks at the beginning of the week but an emergency comes up, those tasks will silently disappear letting you focus on the emergency. If you’re heavily focused for a few months on a couple projects at work, all our other projects will kindly hide themselves in someday/maybe. If we abandon the GTD-ship in despair, when we come back, all our projects will be waiting in storage and easily reactivated.</p>\\n<h2>Moving forward</h2>\\n<p>I’m really excited about my plans. It should be a fun project technically and is software I could really use right now.</p>\\n<h3>How you can get involved</h3>\\n<p>I’d appreciate feedback on my ideas. If you’ve tried and failed with GTD in the past, why did you fail? How did the system you used (software or otherwise) help/hinder you? Did my analysis, that failure comes from an overload of low-priority projects/tasks, resonate with you? Am I missing anything obvious here?</p>\\n<p>Once I get a usable prototype built, I’d love beta testers. Please contact me if you’re interested in getting early access.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 524 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Chatroom Feature for Drupal 6.x built with Node.js and Backbone.js\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"drupal planet\",\"backbone.js\",\"node.js\",\"experiments\"],\"date\":\"2011-10-12T19:47:34.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Recently, for fun and learning, I built a group chatroom feature for Drupal 6.x.

But as I no longer do Drupal\\ndevelopment, maintaining (and even using) Drupal feels like more and more of a burden.\\nSo like the other <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/paulg/status/402205795552489472\\\">cool kids on the internet</a>\\nI decided to convert my site to a static website. Easy to host, zero security updates, and completely customizable.</p>\\n<p>I evaluated quite a few of the <a href=\\\"http://staticgen.com/\\\">popular static site frameworks</a> out there e.g.\\n<a href=\\\"http://jekyllrb.com/\\\">Jekyll</a> and <a href=\\\"http://docpad.org/\\\">Docpad</a> but none of them\\nreally attracted me. It seemed the problem of generating an HTML site was small enough\\nthat with <a href=\\\"http://gulpjs.com\\\">GulpJS</a>, a number of <a href=\\\"https://github.com/KyleAMathews/blog/blob/master/package.json\\\">NPM modules</a>,\\nand some glue code I could easily build my own static site generator.</p>\\n<p>And as hoped, building a custom static site generator turned out to be straightforward.\\nProps to GulpJS and the vast treasure-trove of Node.js modules in the <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.org/\\\">NPM repository</a>.\\nYou can see the meat of the logic for generating this site <a href=\\\"https://github.com/KyleAMathews/blog/blob/master/gulpfile.coffee#L23-L78\\\">at the blog’s repo</a>.</p>\\n<p>The next task was how to host the site. I briefly considered using Amazon S3, which is\\na very attractive option as it’s very fast and essentially infinitely scalable, but decided against\\nit as I wanted a chance to play around with two other software tools, <a href=\\\"http://docker.io\\\">Docker</a> and <a href=\\\"http://nginx.org/\\\">Nginx</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Building applications with Docker</h2>\\n<p>Docker has really captured my and many other developers’ imaginations. Its primary\\nattraction to me is the utter simplicity it enables in packaging and deploying server applications.\\nComing from years of writing complicated <a href=\\\"http://www.getchef.com/\\\">Chef</a> or <a href=\\\"http://www.ansible.com/home\\\">Ansible</a>\\nscripts, being able to bundle each applications’ dependencies together is a breath of\\nfresh air. <a href=\\\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GlobalVariablesAreBad\\\">Global variables (and packages) are bad</a>.\\nDocker lets you completely ignore the “global state” of the server that’s running\\nyour application. It’s truly a “Write once, run anywhere” system. If it works on\\nyour laptop, it’ll work in production no matter where or what it’s installed with.</p>\\n<p>This changes how you think about the boundaries of your application.\\nConsider my case of hosting this static website. Typically you’d think of this blog\\nas the collection of HTML, CSS, and images that make up the site.</p>\\n<p>What you think your application is affects how you deploy it. If your application is a bundle of files then\\n&quot;deploying&quot; means placing these files inside a software system that understands HTTP and can serve files, e.g. Apache or Nginx.</p>\\n<p>Compare this to how I’m using Docker for this blog. Instead of using a global Nginx instance\\nto serve my blog, I create a Docker image with Nginx <em>and</em> my blog’s files. Which makes the resulting &quot;blog application&quot;\\nan atomic unit that I can build, test, and run anywhere as many times as I want.</p>\\n<p>This is a much more preferable outcome. Instead of a messy collection of files as my outcome,\\nwith Docker, I have a neat tidy Docker image. Now to to run a very high-performance blog, all I\\nneed to do is type <code>docker run blog</code> and off it goes.</p>\\n<p>This makes some fun and useful things quite easy. E.g. while writing this post, I was curious how well\\nmy blog would hold up under load testing. I didn’t want to use the container running the live\\nversion of this blog for the testing as that would fill my access logs with useless entries.\\nSo instead, I ran an additional instance of my Docker blog image on the\\nsame server but listening on a different port. I used this twin\\nversion of my blog to do the load testing and threw it away once the testing was finished. Setting up\\na parallel version of this blog would be much more difficult with a global installation of Nginx.</p>\\n<h2>Docker layers</h2>\\n<p>Docker has an additional innovation which I love. Docker lets you create base images\\nwhich your application can build on. Since all static sites need about the same Nginx configuration,\\nI created a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/KyleAMathews/docker-nginx\\\">Nginx Docker image</a>\\nI can use (and anyone else) as a base whenever building a new static website.</p>\\n<p>By encapsulating the Nginx configuration in an image, the Dockerfile (Docker’s DSL\\nfor defining image builds) <a href=\\\"https://github.com/KyleAMathews/blog/blob/master/Dockerfile\\\">for this blog</a> is incredibly simple. Three lines in fact.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">FROM kyma/docker-nginx\\nADD public/ /var/www\\nCMD <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'nginx'</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The first line tells Docker to use my Nginx image as the base, the second says to add\\nthe site’s files within the image at /var/www, and the third says to run Nginx when\\na new container is started.</p>\\n<p>There’s tons of similar base images available on the public Docker image index for building <a href=\\\"https://index.docker.io/search?q=ruby\\\">Ruby</a>,\\n<a href=\\\"https://index.docker.io/search?q=python\\\">Python</a>, <a href=\\\"https://index.docker.io/search?q=go\\\">Go</a>, etc. applications.\\nBut it’s also trivial to create base images for your specific needs. For example, this is\\na <a href=\\\"https://github.com/KyleAMathews/docker-nodejs-base/blob/master/Dockerfile\\\">base image I wrote with the tools I commonly use to build web frontends</a>.\\nI’ve used it now for several side projects of mine.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 529 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = {\"title\":\"Tools to help administer your Facebook Groups\",\"date\":\"2014-05-20T23:46:37.121Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"readNext\":\"/building-your-own-tools/\",\"body\":\"<p>I’m an administrator for an active Facebook group.

reading blogs. I’ve been reading blogs for quite a while now, five years I’d suppose. It has been my privilege during this time to read the discussions and thoughts of hundreds of different intelligent and opinionated blog authors from all around the earth. I’m in college now, this fall will be my Junior year. Everyday I listen to lecture and read from textbooks and most don’t hold a candle to my daily dose of blog news and analysis. The blog is the greatest conversational tool ever invented because seconds after I click publish for this post, it can be read across the world by thousands. Granted, this blog, along with most of the other <a href=\\\"http://www.blogherald.com/2005/10/10/the-blog-herald-blog-count-october-2005/\\\">100 million</a> blogs in existence, won’t be read much. But that’s all right. Conversation is fun, even it’s just with a few of your buds. I’m just happy to join the party.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2006-07-22---first-post/index.md\n ** module id = 413\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Why I blog—Part 1\",\"tags\":[\"Learning\",\"Writing\"],\"date\":\"2006-08-12T22:52:44.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I’d been thinking about blogging for a long time but what finally pushed me over the edge was this <a href=\\\"http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2005/11/22/mclemee\\\">post</a>. The author, Scott McLemee, wrote about what he’s learned from a pamphlet by C. Wright Mill “On Intellectual Craftsmanship”. Here’s the key quote,</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>What Mills calls “intellectual craftsmanship” involves more than the ability to produce work that can pass peer review. “Scholarship is a choice of how to live,” he writes, “as well as a choice of career.” It is (if I may be excused for borrowing another <a href=\\\"http://www.hnn.us/blogs/entries/18349.html\\\">old Greek word</a>) an <em>ethos.</em> That is, a structure of habits that sustains and embodies a quality of mind, a tendency of character.</p>\\n<p>“Whether he knows it or not,” Mills goes on to say, “the intellectual workman forms his own self as he works towards the perfection of his craft.” The notion of having a “career” is subordinate to — even a side-effect of — this process of inner shaping. “To realize his own potentialities, and any opportunities that come his way,” the scholar “constructs a character which has its core the qualities of the good workman.”</p>\\n<p>For Mills, there is a kind of bench where all of this crafting takes place. He calls it “the file.” I’m not sure this is the happiest of expressions. It’s simple enough, but Mills uses it in his own sense.&quot;</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Mills suggests that aspiring young intellectuals keep what he calls, “the file,” or the term I like, “intellectual journal.” Here are collected reading notes, stray ideas, and complications or successes in research. It serves as a journal as you analyze and sort through ideas. Mill writes that the process of collecting and sifting through your notes and ideas leads to more systematic thinking as well as more directed and thorough learning.</p>\\n<p>Starting my junior and senior years of high school, I came to love writing. Not that it is entertaining or easy – it’s about the hardest thing to do intellectually – but for the powerful and beneficial effect it has on my thinking. I find that when I write about an idea I’ve had or a book I’ve read, the writing serves to clarify my thinking and make explicit my reasoning.</p>\\n<p>My experience with the effects of writing fits with Mill’s main assertion, that the keeping of the file or intellectual journal is critical to the “[construction of] a character which has its core the qualities of the good workman.” My writing refined and shaped my intellectual charecter.</p>\\n<p>A critical realization I’ve come to over the past several years is the importance of my habits. My life is directed more by what I choose to do every day then any so-called life changing decisions. I like to think of habits as bricks. A single brick is really quite insignificant but from thousands of bricks mortared together come sturdy houses and soaring cathedrals. And from habits we build, one brick at a time, our lives. My life, whether it will be useful and great or broken and poor, depends a great deal on my habits.</p>\\n<p>The great disconnect in most people’s lives is between what they know they should do and what they actually do. Witness the vast number of people enslaved by addictions: alcohol, drugs, gambling, food, and so forth. What they lack is internal discipline or the character to live what they know is right. For whatever reason they have never built the character that allows their mind to rule their body. Instead, their bodies enslave their minds.</p>\\n<p>So how does this bring us back to Mill’s file? For many years, there has been a disconnect between what I want to be intellectually, and what I actually do, my habits. I feel far too often I don’t think as I should. I don’t analysis, probe, collect, sift, sort, synthesize. In other words, as much as I want to, I don’t have the character of an intellectual workman.</p>\\n<p>My hope is this blog will provide the motivation and discipline to write so as to help me develop the habits of the mind of an intellectual craftsman.</p>\\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Other people seem to be thinking along the same lines: <a href=\\\"http://savageminds.org/2006/08/14/c-wright-mills-on-blogging/\\\">here</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/about\\\">here</a>.

I don’t intend to review the book per se (but here are two good reviews, <a href=\\\"http://www.chicagoboyz.net/archives/004376.html\\\">1</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/06/19/bohea19.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2005/06/19/botop.html\\\">2</a>) but instead comment on some interesting points the author made.</p>\\n<p>First was the level of economic sophistication the Romans reached. Archaeologists evacuating Roman-era sites are consistently overwhelmed by the vast quantity and quality of the pottery they find. Not only is the quantity impressive but there is strong evidence for the existence of large ‘industrial’ producers of pottery that dominating the trade. Pottery from one large producer of tableware in southern France active around 100 A.D. has been found throughout the western Roman empire, past the Hadrian wall into Scotland, and as far east as present-day Moscow.</p>\\n<p>On another site on the left bank of the Tiber in Rome, there stands a hill some 150 feet high. It is made up entirely of broken oil amphorae from southern Spain. It is estimated that the hill has the remains of some 53 million amphorae, in which around six billion liters (1.56 billion gallons or around 2500 Olympic-sized swimming pools) of oil were transported. Obviously, the Romans could move impressive quantities over long distances!</p>\\n<p>With the beginning of the barbarian invasions, the economic complexity ended. The confusion broke continent-wide trade routes and millions were thrust into the dark ages. The author contrasts the remains of two sites, one a tiny farmstead on a difficult upland spot in Italy occupied from 200 BC to 100 A.D., and the other a sixth and seventh-century rural palace of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Northumbria. On the Roman farmstead, evacuation produced an impressive range of pottery vessels: huge storage jars, kitchen wares, some locally produced others imported from the West coast of Italy, amphorae from the same area, and finally, glossy tablewares imported from another pottery in Italy near Naples. Contrast this with the pottery found in post-Roman England as the author, Ward-Perkins describes it, “The vessels were hand-shaped, out of poorly processed clay, and were only lightly fired (so they are very friable).”</p>\\n<p>It’s shocking in a way to see how fragile economies are. Within the span of the lifetime of a Roman born around 400 A.D. much of the prosperity, peace, and security they enjoyed at birth was lost and stayed at pre-Roman levels for nearly 1000 years. Skills as mundane as creating fine pottery or stone buildings were lost in Britain for hundreds of years. The majority of people alive have never seen a real dip in prosperity. In American since the end of WW2, we have seen extremely steady upward growth, the most incredible period of economic growth in history. Virtually everyone alive is richer materially then there parents were and whose parents were richer then there parents were and expects there children to become even richer still.</p>\\n<p>Though the US has the strongest, most diverse, most steady economy in the world, one wanders all the same if it could fall. It was by no means inevitable that we’ve reached this point. Nor is it a sure thing that we will continue to enjoy our present prosperity.</p>\\n<p>I don’t know what the future will bring but I do know I enjoyed my book. It made me think.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2006-09-01---the-fall-civilization-rome-and-fragility-our-own/index.md\n ** module id = 415\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Ubuntu 6.10—Edgy Eft—thoughts on upgrading from Dapper\",\"tags\":[\"Linux\",\"Ubuntu\"],\"date\":\"2006-11-11T03:42:01.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Updated my dapper installation on my laptop to Edgy a while ago.

It seems the changes from Hoary to Dapper were more dramatic. Changes were mostly subtle, tweaks here and there, improvements to programs etc. Linux and Ubuntu are at a stage of maturity that dramatic improvement are hard to pull off. A math analogy, if you add 1 to 1 that is a 100% improvement. If you add 1 to 2 that is a 50% improvement. If you continue that on upward, adding 1 to 100 is only a 1% improvement. Linux is still making good progress just it is not as obvious now due to the substantial work already completed.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2006-11-11---ubuntu-610-edgy-eft-thoughts-upgrading-dapper/index.md\n ** module id = 416\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"A Good Test\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"Learning\"],\"date\":\"2006-12-31T06:37:26.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I recently finished up a semester at <a href=\\\"http://www.byu.edu\\\" title=\\\"BYU\\\">BYU</a>. The end of another semester brings with it that joyful tradition, finals. Going through six finals gave me cause to think quite a bit about tests; what are they for and why are they useful?</p>\\n<p>I came up with three ways to measure the quality of a test:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Does it measure something valuable?</li>\\n<li>Is the test both reliable and valid?</li>\\n<li>Does it provide the correct incentives?</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>Does it measure something valuable?</strong><br>\\nThis depends on the context of the test – a juggling test is valuable for a circus school, a gum chewing test is valuable to aspiring gum gurus, etc. The important questions is, does the test measure one’s understanding of or skill in the valuable part(s) of a subject matter.</p>\\n<p><strong>Is the test both reliable and valid?</strong><br>\\nReliable means the test is consistently administered and graded for all test takers. Valid means the test measures what it intends to. A juggling test which asks a student to hold two balls but not throw them would be a reliable test – all test takers could be measured easily the same – but wouldn’t be valid as being able to hold two balls doesn’t show that one can in fact juggle balls. A professor can prepare a test that measures all students fairly but wouldn’t test the students on anything valuable (as defined above).</p>\\n<p><strong>Does it provide the correct incentives?</strong><br>\\nI haven’t worked this measure out satisfactorily in my mind yet but it’s something like the following. People’s behavior is shaped by incentives. Because tests are a major part of a class grade and most students care about grades, tests motivate students to study more then they would without the incentive. So far this is fine and dandy. I for one appreciate tests for this very reason as I know I’ve studied more, and learned more, over the years because of tests.</p>\\n<p><strong>So why can this go wrong?</strong><br>\\nStudents go to school to learn, presumably. There is of course the old yarn that education is the only thing that Americans pay for and hope to be cheated. Many students it seems care more about the grade then for learning. Because learning is hard, there is a strong incentive for students to try to ‘game’ the test. Some types of tests can be passed by cramming the night before the tests. Tests that only require you to memorize material don’t promote true learning. So this poorer sort of test would provide the wrong incentive to students in that it pushes them toward the poorer sort of learning. A good test would push students toward the richer, and harder, sort of learning.</p>\\n<p>Now what types of tests provide the correct or wrong incentives I’m not quite sure. As I said, I haven’t completely worked this measure out. I’m not even sure if it is a correct measure. If at some point I can work up more interest in this topic to clarify my thinking, I’ll write another post. Or someone else can save me the work and write it themselves (or link to a page in the comments section).</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2006-12-31---a-good-test/index.md\n ** module id = 417\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Take Risks to Open Options\",\"tags\":[\"entrepreneurship\",\"Learning\"],\"date\":\"2007-02-15T06:20:32.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I was reading a <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2007/02/entrepreneur_hi.html\\\">blog post</a> earlier by <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/blog/\\\">Ross Mayfield.</a> He was asked what were his <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2007/02/entrepreneur_hi.html\\\">best decision and worst mistake as an entrepreneur.</a></p>\\n<p>All his answers were good but I was especially struck by what he calls his biggest mistake:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>Biggest Mistake – Not taking bigger risks earlier</strong></p>\\n<p>Maybe because in hindsight all risks are clear, but I always find myself regretting not taking bigger risks earlier. For example, open sourcing the Socialtext code was something we waited on until the company had strong footing. Partially because we thought there would be cannibalization, partially because we were understaffed to really engage with the community. But I believe if we bought this bullet earlier in the history of the company we would be reaping better rewards. As a planning exercise, now I always try to ask two questions: “How could we take more risk?” and “What risk can we take that creates the greatest amount of options?” I find there is always a way to do a little more, in particular by getting past instinct to control prevalent in so many entrepreneurs.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I was so struck because I’m in the middle of taking a big risk.</p>\\n<p>I am passionate about web development. I want to build web applications that enable people to connect, collaborate, and get more done in their lives. But at my current and soon to be past job, I’m not learning how to build these beautiful web applications.</p>\\n<p>So I decided to quit and employee myself. I decided that as no one is going to pay me to learn how to do web development, I’ll just have to pay myself.</p>\\n<p>And now my mom, older sister, and I are going into business together. In a few months, we’ll unveil <a href=\\\"http://www.los-detalles.com\\\">Los-Detalles.com</a>, the newest and greatest baby card announcement e-retailer. And in the months leading up the our launch, I will be learning web development.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Mayfield\\\">Ross Mayfield</a> learned it was a mistake to not take risks but that taking (calculated) risks opens up options where caution and control can never go.

By taking this risk, the options <em>I</em> want to have will open to me.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2007-02-15---take-risks-open-options/index.md\n ** module id = 418\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Writing and The Power of Stories\",\"tags\":[\"Writing\"],\"date\":\"2007-02-24T22:47:21.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I’ve been thinking lately about stories. The stories we tell others, the stories we tell ourselves, and the stories we find in books and on TV. There is a great power in stories. Stories change how we think and view the world. Marketers know this – every advertisement is a story. A particularly famous example of this is <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Fogle\\\" title=\\\"Jared the Subway Guy\\\">Jared the Subway guy</a>. His story of how he lost weight from eating subways powerfully sells the idea that Subway’s food is healthy.</p>\\n<p>Earlier I was looking at the website for the <a href=\\\"http://www.python.org/\\\" title=\\\"Python\\\">Python programming language</a>. One might think a website devoted to a programming language, a technical and geeky subject, wouldn’t have any stories. But no, programming languages have stories too apparently, there are some 33 “<a href=\\\"http://www.python.org/about/success\\\">success stories</a>” written by users of Python.</p>\\n<p>Oftentimes, while reading or listening, we only remember the stories the speech or book. Jesus Christ was a master at teaching with stories, or parables (a story with a moral) as they are called in the Bible. In his seminal book, “<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_the_Christ_(book_by_James_E._Talmage)\\\" title=\\\"Jesus the Christ -- from Wikipedia\\\">Jesus the Christ</a>”, <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_E._Talmage\\\" title=\\\"James Talmage\\\">James Talmage</a> wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>[A] simple story will live, even in minds which for the time being are incapable of comprehending any meaning beyond that of the commonplace story itself. Many a peasant who heard the little incident of the sower and the four kinds of soil, of the tares sown by an enemy at night, of the seed that grew through the planter had temporarily forgotten it, would be reminded by the recurring circumstances of his daily work. . . and then, when time and experience, including suffering perhaps, had prepared them for deeper thought, they would find the living kernel of gospel truth within the husk of the simple tale.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>As social animals, we love to tell stories. We turn every event in our life into a story. A friend meeting another friend, the first word of of their mouths is, “I’ve got to tell you what happened last night”. We have this strong impulse inside us to turn our lives into a story.</p>\\n<p>This blog post started to form when I was thinking about journal writing. I was trying to understand what compels me to write in my journal and why is the experience of writing so powerful. While thinking, I had the insight that it’s because of stories.</p>\\n<p>When I write in my journal I find my story and myself. I weave the threads of my life, past, present, and future, into a coherent story. I create a plot line, a protagonist (me hopefully), antagonists, and an destiny. I decide why what happened, happened, I decide what needs to happen and if my story is in need of a plot or character shift.</p>\\n<p>“Know yourself”, the Philosopher shouts. I write to know myself. I write as a historian, to know my past. I write as a journalist, to know my present. And I must write as a prophet, write my most powerful stories, to know my future.</p>\\n<p>What if my life doesn’t have a story? Then my life is meaningless, without root or branch. I am not stable but pushed about by every fad or fashion. So in short, writing a journal helps me discover my story. And knowing my story gives me purpose and direction.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2007-02-24---writing-and-the-power-of-stories/index.md\n ** module id = 419\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Enterprise 2.0 — A Summary Post\",\"tags\":[\"enterprise2.0\"],\"date\":\"2007-03-14T13:53:48.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I have long been fascinated by the new technologies, blogs, wikis, and so forth, that collectively make up what is known as enterprise2.0. I am fascinated by their promise to revolutionize, as email, how we work and how we communicate and I want to be part of developing these technologies. This post is a compilation of many of the things I’ve read about enterprise 2.0. It is an attempt to make the case for why four technologies, wikis, blogs, Content Resource Management (CRM), and web-based project management tools, should be used in the enterprise (and every other organization for that manner).</p>\\n<p>Organizations want good collaboration and management tools. What are the properties of an idea collaboration/management tool?</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>the tool is as simple as possible, but not too simple</li>\\n<li>inexpensive</li>\\n<li>easy setup/maintenance</li>\\n<li>all can contribute</li>\\n<li>works with existing tools</li>\\n<li>just works</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Business analysts are recognizing these needs are unfulfilled by today’s groupware tools. Developers and companies around the globe have created new collaboration tools to solve these problems. Examples of these tools include: wikis, blogs, lightweight project management tools, and online calendaring software. These tools and the philosophy behind them have come to be known collectively under the name of Enterprise 2.0. These tools have come to the attention of academics and large companies such as IBM and Microsoft who are implementing many of these ideas into their software. IBM’s Lotus Notes supports the creation of blogs and wikis. Microsoft’s new Sharepoint 2007 includes a tightly-integrated wiki.</p>\\n<p>The vast user base of already installed Enterprise 2.0 software tools show the great potential of social software within the enterprise. Enterprise 2.0 tools promise to provide more flexible and efficient collaboration within organizations.</p>\\n<p>Andrew McAfee, professor at Harvard Business School <a href=\\\"http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/enterprise_20_version_20/\\\">defines Enterprise 2.0</a> as follows</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Enterprise 2.0 is the use of emergent social software platforms within companies, or between companies and their partners or customers.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>‘Freeform’ in this case means that the software is most or all of the following:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Optional</li>\\n<li>Free of up-front workflow</li>\\n<li>Egalitarian, or indifferent to formal organizational identities</li>\\n<li>Accepting of many types of data</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Or as put more simply by <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/\\\">Ross Mayfield of Socialtext</a>: “<a href=\\\"http://many.corante.com/archives/2005/05/25/fear_greed_and_social_software.php\\\">Social Software adapts to its environment</a>, instead of requiring its environment to adapt to software”</p>\\n<p>What this means is social software is not a one-size fits all type of software. It does not try to rigidly fit a company and its processes into the preconceived notions of the software’s creators.</p>\\n<p>Corporations for years have tried to install industrial-strength collaboration tools <a href=\\\"http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6087566.html\\\">but employees don’t use them</a>. This is the natural result of software attempting to impose processes. People don’t like to change behavior to fit software.</p>\\n<p>Better are collaboration tools that allow emergence. “<a href=\\\"http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/enterprise_20_version_20/\\\">Emergent means that the software is freeform</a>, and that it contains mechanisms to let the patterns and structure inherent in people’s interactions become visible over time.” Or in other words, emergent software merely discovers the way employees think and act in particular environment. Only then are business processed defined. The practice defines the process.(find link) This means employees are much more likely to actually use the tools IT rolls out as they can use the tools in a way that feels natural.</p>\\n<p>A college in California applied the principle of emergence to the construction of new sidewalks between buildings. Instead of building the sidewalks right away, they let students walk on the new grass for a semester. At the end of the semester, it was evident by the tramped grass where most students wanted to walk. So the sidewalks were built where the grass was tramped.</p>\\n<p>Software based collaboration tools let people collaborate anywhere and at anytime. Collaboration on ideas isn’t restricted to one meeting room or one office. People can collaborate between meetings, after hours, or anytime an idea occurs to them.</p>\\n<p>Software collaboration tools make finding help easier. When searching for an answer, it is better to ask as many people as possible because you don’t know in advance who has the answer, a technique called “<a href=\\\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5544.html\\\">broadcast search</a>”. Collaboration tools such as wikis or blogs let you ask everyone in the organization. <a href=\\\"http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/comments/tear_down_these_walls/\\\">The British Parliament in the 18th century offered the equivalent of about $12 million</a> to anyone who could devise a method to ‘find longitude.’ “The prize was eventually won, not by a famed astronomer or scientist of the day, but by the self-taught Yorkshire clockmaker John Harrison.” Another example, <a href=\\\"http://www.socialtext.com/node/113\\\">a sales manager at the commercial wiki company Socialtext</a> was asked by a prospective customer for a comparison between forums and wikis. Not knowing much about the topic, he created a wiki page on the companies wiki and broadcast throughout the company that he needed help. “Within four hours, five team members, including engineers, had contributed to the wiki page with numerous revisions. I had basically a final version that I simply exported as a Word doc, tweaked with final formatting, and emailed to the customer.” He reflects that he could of asked one or two people in marketing for help but the result wouldn’t of been nearly as good as the result from the wiki.</p>\\n<p>Software collaboration software creates a “group memory”. All content created with collaboration tools is achieved and easily searchable. No more will valuable ideas and plans be lost in an email inbox or the Intranet. This creates a quick ramp-up time for new employees and provides a convenient record of all past projects discussions.</p>\\n<p>Results from early adapters of “Enterprise 2.0” tools are starting to return. Business Week reported in November of 2005 that “research firm Garner Group predicts that wikis will become mainstream collaboration tools in at least 50% of companies by 2009…At DrKW, [CIO JP] Rangaswami says that among the earliest and most aggressive adopters, e-mail volume on related projects is down 75%; meeting times have been whacked in half.”</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.socialtext.com/customers/case-studies/drkw\\\">In an extensive case study written about wiki adoption at DrKW</a>, reporting on meetings they wrote, “The teleconference used to be one and a half hours long [before the wiki], with much time wasted on bringing people up to speed on the week’s events. Now team members update themselves on the wiki, and that part of the teleconference takes five to ten minutes.”</p>\\n<p>Employees of DrKW also find the wiki useful to plan presentations. They report that now with a wiki, “one person co-ordinated [planning the presentation], setting up an agenda page and individual pages for each of the main slides so that everyone - asynchronously, in their own time and in parallel - could write the presentation. Within about three of four hours, a presentation evolved that would have taken days and been a much more frustrating process had it been through email and PowerPoint attachments.”</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://billives.typepad.com/portals_and_km/2006/06/making_wikis_wo.html\\\">Employees at Novell also find that wikis ease collaboration</a>. When someone finds an article on a discussion within the company, they link the article as a comment to a wiki page on the topic. This is accessible to enterprise search and those who are “tracking” this page are notified immediately of the addition to the wiki page. When someone finds the page, they have all the context available to understand the complete discussion. Novell finds wikis reduce redundancy in research and dialog and makes collaboration much more efficient.</p>\\n<p>Both DrKW and Novell and many others find that the tools of “Enterprise 2.0” make collaboration more flexible and efficient. Below is a closer look at the software that makes up “Enterprise 2.0”:</p>\\n<h2>Internal Blogs</h2>\\n<p>Most now are familiar with blogs. These easy-to-use communication device are widely used on the Internet by from everyone from politicians, to family groups, to newspapers. As of 14 March 2007, Technorati, an online blog search engine, <a href=\\\"http://technorati.com/about/\\\">is tracking 71.2 million blogs</a>. Blogs as a collaboration tool are widely used on the Internet but are also starting to gain traction as a tool for internal communication within organizations.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.globalprblogweek.com/2005/09/19/dutto-internal-blogs/\\\">Matías Dutto, a management consultant specializing in social technologies</a>, wrote the following reasons for supporting internal blogging:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>It improves participation spirit, collaboration, and the capabilities of team learning. It is ideal to run projects and to work with heterogeneous teams. It is also useful to promote dialogue and find lateral ideas outside the team.</li>\\n<li>It allows integrating conversations with a shared vision. It is an excellent means for the leaders to communicate.</li>\\n<li>It is the space where interpretations and different points of view come up so that the any member of the organization can discuss and debate them.</li>\\n<li>It is an excellent means for the employees to achieve an integrated vision of the company by joining in conversations.</li>\\n<li>It implies an open communication platform that allows new ways relating and coordinating actions among the organizational members and between the latter and the network of external relationships.</li>\\n<li>It becomes the written memory of the organization. Furthermore, writing conveys emotional stability which eventually promotes the process of organizational development.</li>\\n<li>They speed up the transference and transformation of knowledge to make ideas flow easily and take learning into action.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Enterprise quality blogging software includes:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.drupal.org\\\">Drupal</a> (open source)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.userland.com/\\\">Manila</a> (paid)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.21publish.com/\\\">21Publish</a> (paid)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.typepad.com/\\\">Typepad</a> (paid)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/\\\">Moveable Type</a> (paid)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.knownow.com/\\\">KnowHow</a> (paid/open source) – enterprise version of WordPress</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Wikis</h2>\\n<p>The most famous example of the wiki is Wikipedia. <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki\\\">Wikipedia defines a wiki as</a> “a website that allows the visitors themselves to easily add, remove, and otherwise edit and change available content, typically without the need for registration.

My problem was that because cron doesn’t run in the X session (The program that controls all GUIs in Linux), when you try to run a GUI program, cron doesn’t know where to start it.

One article I read recently by Clay entitled, &quot;<a href=\\\"http://shirky.com/writings/community_scale.html\\\">Communities, Audiences, and Scale</a>&quot;is especially good and provided much of the inspiration for this post. The gist of the article is that audiences scale and communities don’t. And understanding this principle I think is extra ordinarily important for designers of social software.</p>\\n<p>So what is the difference between audiences and communities? Audiences primarily consume content, communities primarily communicate with one another. TVs have audiences – they have large numbers of people that watch their content. But there is very little communication between individual watchers of TV and between the watchers and the makers of TV content. On the other hand, a small group of men who gather to play cards on Friday nights is a community – because they actively communicate with one another. Communities communicate with one another, audiences don’t.</p>\\n<p>In addition, a group is a group and a community is a community because of the connections that form between its members. Two best friends have very strong connections. A high school basketball team has connections from running lines and sitting on the bus together for long road trips.</p>\\n<p>But connections get weaker and weaker as a group or community adds more members. Connections are created by communication. With two people, all communications happens between the two people. So the connections made are very strong. Add another person and the number of connections that need to be maintained increases from 1 to 3. Add another person making 4 in the group and the number of connections increases from 3 to 6. Add another member and the connections become 10 (<a href=\\\"http://shirky.com/writings/community_scale.html#2\\\">read Clay for more of the math</a>). Obviously as the group grows larger and larger, the bonds weaken between individual members of the group.</p>\\n<p>This idea is encapsulated in several common English expressions like “two’s company, three’s a crowd”. Amongst young people, a person who tries to hang out with a couple feels like and is sometimes referred to as a “<a href=\\\"http://www.goenglish.com/ThirdWheel.asp\\\">third wheel</a>”. It’s possible to have 2-3 best friends but no more. The “gang” you hung out with in high school probably had 4-7 people but no more. Older people tend to have fewer friends then younger adults but with closer bonds. Clay Shirky references the research of primatologist Robin Dunbar who argues that, “humans are adapted for social group sizes of around 150 or less, a size that shows up in a number of traditional societies, as well as in present day groups such as the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutterite\\\">Hutterite religious communities</a>.”</p>\\n<p>This contradicts a fundamental assumption of most designers of social software that “more users is always a good thing.” Different types of groups can maintain their identity to different sizes but at some scale all online communities start to lose the dense interconnections that make the community a community.</p>\\n<p>The line where an audience begins and a community ends can get rather murky with online social software. Consider for example the weblog. If three girlfriends use blogs to discuss their lives, this is obviously a community. On the other hand, a popular blogger such as <a href=\\\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/\\\">Seth Goodin</a> is not supporting a community on its blog but is operating a broadcast media platform much as CNN or Fox News.</p>\\n<p>I’m experiencing a good example of this murkiness. <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list\\\">A Mailing list</a> is an example of social software often used to support online communities. I am a student at BYU majoring in Information Systems. The ISys department at BYU provides a mailing list for the use of the 200+ students who are in the ISys major. The mailing list is quite popular – I’d say it sees an average of 10-20 emails a day during the school year</p>\\n<p>But the funny thing I’ve observed in the year or so I’ve been on the list is that even though everyone has equal rights to email the list, I see the same 10-15 names over and over. The rest of the ISys students don’t communicate via the mailing list but rather are audience members. So it seems the mailing list, as a community-building device, can’t scale past a certain number of people.</p>\\n<p>So why does it matter if our social software isn’t so social at times, or that not everyone can/will participate on a mass mailing list? We should care because we are social creatures. In our increasingly rushed and splintered world, technology can help fulfill our need for friends and community.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/\\\">Joel Spolsky</a>, in a post entitled “<a href=\\\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BuildingCommunitieswithSo.html\\\">Building Communities with Software</a>” speaks movingly of our need as humans for community and how social software can fulfill that need. He ends his post with this message, “Creating community, in any case, is a noble goal, because it’s sorely missing for so many of us. Let’s keep plugging away at it.”</p>\\n<p>Social software done right can create a community for all its participants. I feel strongly about the need for excellent social software, in our schools, workplaces, and other organizations. Social software can help us learn, work, and live with greater effectiveness and joy.</p>\\n<p>In my next few posts I’ll continue to explore the fundamental problems and opportunities with social software.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2007-08-09---twos-company-threes-a-crowd-why-better-social-software-needed-support-small-group-in/index.md\n ** module id = 427\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Why I blog—Part 2\",\"tags\":[\"blogging\",\"internet-marketing\",\"Learning\",\"Writing\"],\"date\":\"2007-10-26T04:57:56.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>A year ago in just <a href=\\\"/why-i-blog-part-1/\\\">my second blog post</a>, I explained why I write a blog. My answer then (and now) is I keep a blog as an intellectual journal of sorts. Blogging is my way of pulling together into a coherent form all the stray thoughts rolling around in my mind. Writing helps me sift the good thoughts from all the bad and fit them all together in a logical pattern.</p>\\n<p>Keeping an intellectual journal is the main reason for writing my blog. My secondary reason is pure economics. Blogging is a loss-leader of sorts. Through this blog I market myself and my ideas to people who I hope to do business with eventually.</p>\\n<p>Along those lines I read a <a href=\\\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2007/10/comment_is_free.cfm\\\">blog post today from The Economist</a> website. The author was commenting on a <a href=\\\"http://files.ssds.ucdavis.edu/chsc/Discover_Your_Inner_Economist.mp4\\\">recent podcast on the economics of blogging by Tyler Cowen</a> (of <a href=\\\"http://www.marginalrevolution.com/\\\">Marginal Revolution</a> fame).</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>While the direct economic return to authoring a blog may not appear to justify the effort, the prospect of actively demonstrating one’s skillset for an interested public, many members of which work in talent-hungry organisations that pay real salaries, is an attractive one. Why waste time submitting CVs, when you could cultivate an audience of potential employers intimately familiar with your talents?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Interestingly, this effect could generate a filtering effect on the blogosphere quite opposed to the market for lemon model <a href=\\\"http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/10/is-the-econ-blo.html\\\">proposed</a> by Dani Rodrik. If blog writers generally have employment in mind, we should expect those with strong resumés but lackluster ideas to abstain from extensive blogging, while those whose critical and analytical skills run ahead of the experience and education categories on their CVs should embrace blogging as a means to signal their exceptional fitness. We would expect those with most to gain from blogging to blog more.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I’ve always found school boring and homework a less then optimal use of my time. So my grades reflect that. “Good students” use grades as a signaling mechanism. A student with good grades is telling potential employers, “I’m reasonably intelligent and can tolerate boredom” – which is what’s really required at school and most jobs.</p>\\n<p>As my grades aren’t going to impress anyone, I compensate by blogging. I use this blog to “show off”, so to speak, my critical and analytic skills, my ideas, and my passion for social software, learning, and collaboration to potential employers.</p>\\n<p>But for now this is all theory–whether this works or not is still a bit up in the air. . . but in the meantime it’s better then homework. . . and since I’m done writing, back now to accounting homework I guess :&gt;</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2007-10-26---why-i-blog-part-2/index.md\n ** module id = 428\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"I really liked these insights\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"entrepreneurship\",\"innovation\",\"Learning\",\"Uncategorized\"],\"date\":\"2007-12-31T21:25:54.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>From the <a href=\\\"http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10328123\\\">Economist:</a></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>At some point in the decade after he moved from the farm in Nebraska where he grew up to the innovation hub that is the San Francisco Bay Area, Evan Williams accidentally stumbled upon three insights:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>that genuinely new ideas are, well, accidentally stumbled upon rather than sought out</li>\\n<li>second, that new ideas are by definition hard to explain to others, because words can express only what is already known</li>\\n<li>and third, that good ideas seem obvious in retrospect.</li>\\n</ol>\\n</blockquote>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2007-12-31---i-really-liked-these-insights/index.md\n ** module id = 429\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"What I've been up to lately\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"elearning2.0\",\"social software\"],\"date\":\"2008-01-02T01:56:46.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I’ve gotten involved in a number of new projects in the past 6-7 months so thought I’d update y’all in what I’m doing.</p>\\n<h3>School:</h3>\\n<p>After a lovely summer break with no school and my time spent vacationing and working at a number of jobs, I came back to <a href=\\\"http://byu.edu\\\">BYU</a> for my first semester in the <a href=\\\"http://isys.byu.edu\\\">Masters of Information Systems program</a>. But, as my classes this past semester were pretty boring, I won’t mention school anymore here.</p>\\n<h3>E-commerce websites:</h3>\\n<p>I’ve built two e-commerce sites over the past six months using <a href=\\\"http://ubercart.org\\\">Ubercart</a> (a fantastic open source shopping cart – if you’re in the market for that sort of thing). Ubercart is a module (cf. plugin/extension) for <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org\\\" title=\\\"drupal\\\">Drupal</a>, an open source <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system\\\">content management system</a>, another technology I’ve been working with extensively.</p>\\n<p>This past June, with two friends, I started a t-shirt company running out of our apartment. As the lone techie, I built our website at <a href=\\\"http://coolcamisa.com\\\">coolcamisa.com</a>. By our expectations, the company has been a rousing success (i.e., we didn’t lose money)! We paid back our start-up costs by September (2 1/2 months from launch) and have netted some two grand since then. Not bad for our little apartment-based bootstrapped business. I’ve learned tons about starting a business, legal stuff (we organized as an LLC), pricing, marketing, website development, etc.</p>\\n<p>My second e-commerce site I started just recently. A good friend of mine, Nicole Sheahan, released her first CD in December (She’s an excellent singer btw, <a href=\\\"http://nicolesheahan.com/product/invisible-facts\\\">so go buy her cd</a>). I’ve been helping her set up a website to sell / market her music. The site is still a work in progress but it’s amazing to me how fast it has come together. I’ve been working with open source software for awhile but I’m still impressed that I can singlehandedly put together a fully functional ecommerce store in under 10 hours for no cost other then my labor. That’s the power of a community.</p>\\n<h3>Other (Drupal) web sites:</h3>\\n<p>With a friend, I’ve been volunteering to build a website for the Utah Valley Ministerial Association. The <a href=\\\"http://utahvalleyinterfaith.org\\\">website</a> will have news and events from churches in Utah County and serve as an online directory of churches in Utah County and surrounding communities. The site is not yet fully operational but it’s soon in coming. Drupal’s “<a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/views\\\">Views</a>” module was the real workhorse here slicing and dicing the church listings for display in a number of different ways. As you can see on the website, the different “views” of the data enable a user to find churches by city, denomination, or language.</p>\\n<h4>Family History Site</h4>\\n<p>Because of my Mormon heritage, the genealogy of my ancestors is very well done. Most of my ancestoral lines are traced back to the 17-18th centuries. About two years ago, my siblings/parents and I decided that while it’s great to have names, dates, and places from our ancestors, what is really interesting is to read the stories and letters they wrote and view pictures of them and where they lived. These stories/letters/pictures/etc. flesh out the skeletal data we see on the normal family history tree.</p>\\n<p>But while current genealogical software does very well at organizing, storing, and sharing genealogical data, it does a poor job at handling other types of information. Documents and pictures tend to get lost in attics of aunts/uncles/grandparents. If you don’t have them, they’re hard to get hold of and you have them, they’re hard to share with relatives.</p>\\n<p>We decided the best solution to this problem would be to create a website. Our first answer was a <a href=\\\"http://familyhistory.mathews2000.com/\\\">wiki</a> <a href=\\\"http://bunker.mathews2000.com/\\\">website</a>. The wiki software made it easy for our widely distributed family to work together on gathering information. But after some time we grew dissatisfied with the limitations of our wiki software and decided to migrate our site to one based on Drupal. That migration is still in progress but we’re excited as Drupal will give us much more control over how information is stored and displayed (albeit with a great deal more complexity).</p>\\n<h3>A New Job</h3>\\n<p>In June, I started working as an research assistant at <a href=\\\"http://byu.edu\\\">BYU</a> in the <a href=\\\"http://ebusiness.byu.edu/\\\">Kevin &amp; Debra Rollin’s Center for eBusiness</a>.</p>\\n<p>I’m working with a professor and a pH.D student studying how web2.0 technologies can be used in the classroom to help students become more active learners.</p>\\n<p>So far I can say this is the best job I’ve ever had. What I’m doing and learning just fascinates me.</p>\\n<p>Our main research thrust this past semester was creating a community site for a class to use at BYU – <a href=\\\"http://isyscore.byu.edu/drupal\\\">http://isyscore.byu.edu/drupal</a>.</p>\\n<p>We have learned a lot from the experience – and it’s given us mountains of data to sift through – more on that in the future hopefully. Building the site showed me again the power Drupal gives a website developer (even if they really don’t know what they’re doing) to create sophisticated sites.</p>\\n<p>My other big project for my research job is creating a new module for Drupal called <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/writing_assignment\\\">writing_assignment</a>.

Power laws are known by other names such as the 20-80 rule (80% of wealth is controlled by 20% of the population), the long tail, Winner-Take-All, etc.</p>\\n<p>Here is an example power law graph from Wikipedia:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./300px-Long_tail.svg.png\\\" alt=\\\"Power Law\\\"></p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html\\\">Many</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.kottke.org/03/02/weblogs-and-power-laws\\\">have</a> <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2006/04/power_law_of_pa.html\\\">written</a> that almost all measures of web site usage follow the same pattern whether that be page views, in-bound links, etc.</p>\\n<p>This past semester I built an <a href=\\\"http://isyscore.byu.edu/drupal\\\">e-learning site</a> for two sections of an upper-level university course at Brigham Young University. Now that the semester is finished, we’ve started to analyze the data we’ve collected on how students used the site.</p>\\n<p>And what did I notice when I started to graph the data? Why the power law of course.</p>\\n<p>So onto the graphs I made.</p>\\n<p>First is a graph of the number of comments each student made on the class website throughout the semester. This is a good measure of their engagement with the online community. You can see that some students left as many as 40-60 comments throughout the semester and others left as little as 1 or two:<img src=\\\"./num_comments_per_student.png\\\" alt=\\\"Number of comments made by each student\\\"></p>\\n<p>Another graph which follows the power law. This time a graph of the number of visits to the class website per student. Again we see a wide disparity between students. One student visited the site over 400 times! Which in a four month semester means they visited the site on average 3 times a day! And on the other end, a number of students only visited the site 5-10 times the entire semester.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./num_visits_to_site_per_student.png\\\" alt=\\\"Number of visits to the site made by each student\\\"></p>\\n<h3>Why the Power Law?</h3>\\n<p>So why does this happen? Why do some students participate on the class website so much more then other students? I’m not sure I know the answer to that. Why do some people write blogs, participate in Wikipedia, upload their photos to flickr, etc. and many others don’t?</p>\\n<p>Do some students just not see <a href=\\\"/why-i-blog-part-1/\\\">the value of blogging</a>? Are some students more comfortable interacting online for whatever reason? Or on another tact, does it matter if some students participate more then others? After all, in any community, there’s always a core group which cares much more then others about the success of the community (read about the <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2006/04/power_law_of_pa.html\\\">power law of participation</a>). What type of participation in an online learning community meets the learning goals for a classroom?</p>\\n<p>There’s a host of other ideas rumbling around in my head about power laws, the three types of networks (political, social, creative) and how all this relates to creating effective online learning/collaborative environments.

I and the other researchers use web analytics extensively in evaluating the effectiveness of websites we build. This post is the first in a two-part series about why and how to use web analytics for your social learning website.</p>\\n<p>This first part explains a bit about what web analytics is and why you should use it.</p>\\n<h3>Why web analytics</h3>\\n<p>All websites have a reason for existence. Depending on the site the reason could be to make money, provide leads, provide support, teach students, etc. Using web analytics helps you achieve your site’s purpose in two ways:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Using web analytics, you can measure the experience and behavior of visitors to your website. Using what is known as KPI (Key Performance Indicators) you can evaluate if your site is meeting your goals for visitors to the website–or not.</li>\\n<li>Using these KPIs you can identify areas where your site is failing to meet its goals and where it’s doing well</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>From these insights, you make decisions on what to do to improve the website. Then you evaluate the success of your changes by measuring changes in the experiences and behavior of visitors to your site, again using your KPIs (I’ll write more about KPIs in Part II).</p>\\n<p>In short, web analytics exists to power the generation of actionable insights.</p>\\n<h3>Web analytics seeks to measure three things</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Behavior?–What visitors do on the website – how often do they visit, what pages do they visit most, how long do they stay on different pages?</li>\\n<li>Outcomes–all websites have desired outcomes. The exact desired outcome varies site-to-site depending on its goals. Some sites want visitors to sign up as members. That’s one outcome. An e-commerce site’s desired outcome is a purchase. A support site’s desired outcome is for the visitor to find the answer to the question they had.</li>\\n<li>Experience–answer why the visitor did what they did.\\n<ul>\\n<li>Why did the customer add an item to his shopping cart, go through all the steps of the checkout process and then leave the site? Did they find the same item for cheaper on another site? Was the shipping price too high?</li>\\n<li>Similar questions can be asked about a social learning site. Why doesn’t one student ever visit the site? Why does another student visit twice a day. Why does a student do what they do?</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2006/05/got-surveys-recommendations-from-the-trenches.html\\\">Surveys</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2006/05/experimentation-and-testing-a-primer.html\\\">testing and experimentation</a> are some of the best ways to understand visitor’s experience.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>In my mind, the third thing is most important. It’s nice to know that a student spent an hour looking at online learning content but we’d really love to know why they did it. Did the student spend the hour because they were studying for a test? Were they finishing an assignment? Is the material helpful? What material is most helpful? Do they enjoy learning with the material?</p>\\n<p>So behavior and outcomes give you the raw data about what’s happening but experience helps you understand visitors in a more holistic manner. Understanding experience gets you into the mind of visitors to your site. Why they do what they do.</p>\\n<h3>Recap</h3>\\n<p>Web analytics help you improve your site in the following manner.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Web Analytics provides you with information to understand what visitors do on your site and why.</li>\\n<li>Using this information, you identify weakness you can correct.</li>\\n<li>You experiment with potential improvements and test your changes using your web analytic data.</li>\\n<li>Repeat starting at step 1</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Part I explained what web analytics is and why it is valuable. Part II will explain step-by-step how to use web analytics on a social learning site. I will explain the process I’m going through to implement web analytics on a new social learning website I’m building for <a href=\\\"http://byu.edu\\\">BYU</a>.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-03-27---how-use-web-analytics-social-learning-or-elearning-websites/index.md\n ** module id = 440\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Drupal Memetracker Module — My Google Summer of Code Application\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"memetracker\",\"social software\",\"google summer of code\"],\"date\":\"2008-04-04T23:03:38.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\\n<p>I propose to write two modules for <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org\\\">Drupal</a> as part of <a href=\\\"http://code.google.com/soc/2008/\\\">Google Summer of Code</a>. One called <strong>memetracker</strong> and the other called <strong>machinelearningapi</strong>. The memetracker module will use algorithms in the machinelearningapi to intelligently filter and group content from designated content sources both internal and external. The module’s purpose is to find and display to a community in real time the most interesting conversations and memes within the community as they emerge.</p>\\n<p>My project will emulate functionality of successful commercial memetrackers such as <a href=\\\"http://techmeme.com\\\">Techmeme</a>, <a href=\\\"http://news.google.com\\\">Google News</a>, <a href=\\\"http://tailrank.com\\\">Tailrank</a>, and <a href=\\\"http://megite.com\\\">Megite</a>. It will be an open-source implementation of <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetracker\\\">memetracking technology</a> that can be easily plugged into Drupal-based community sites.</p>\\n<p>I wrote up my idea twice on <a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org\\\">groups.drupal.org</a>, <a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/9730\\\">my initial proposal</a> and <a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/10276\\\">my second proposal</a></p>\\n<h2>Benefits to Drupal/Open Source Community:</h2>\\n<p>The memetracker module will solve a common problem faced by many online communities. Perhaps the best way to explain the value of my module is to explain my experience with this problem and how the memetracker module will help solve this problem.</p>\\n<h3>What’s my Problem?</h3>\\n<p>For eight months now I’ve been building social learning websites for classes at <a href=\\\"http://byu.edu\\\">Brigham Young University</a> where I’m a graduate student. Working with a few professors, I build websites for their classes to be used as a learning tool by them and their students. Our goal is to understand what web2.0 tools / principles help most in education.</p>\\n<p>Any online community, like the ones I create for school, generates lots of content and conversations. As a community grows, a problem that soon emerges is how to help individual members find the content/conversations they are most interested in. If there’s only a few members in the online community, it’s easy to follow every conversation. But if there’s 100s or 1000s of members, it soon becomes impossible to follow or find every interesting conversation. This dynamic sets an upper limit on the number of members for most online communities.</p>\\n<p>In researching ways that online communities help participants find the most interesting content/conversations, I’ve found three patterns which help.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>First is the <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network\\\">small-world pattern</a>. Via <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/og\\\">Organic Groups</a>, you split conversations by topic. Members congregate around only the groups they are interested in.</li>\\n<li>Second is the <a href=\\\"http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/nearly-a-million-users-and-no-spam-or-trolls\\\">Twitter pattern</a>. Using <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/buddylist2\\\">buddylist</a> or <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/user_relationships\\\">user_relationships</a>, members follow friends or people who’s ideas they find interesting.</li>\\n<li>The third pattern is for members to read the most interesting memes as they are somehow determined by the community (this is where my module will help out).</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Drupal sites normally implement the third pattern by having human editors manually promote the most interesting content to the front page. But I’ve found this solution to be inadequate. Human editors miss many interesting pieces of content, are prone to bias, and the solution is labor intensive. Also, promoting content to the front page doesn’t group the content by conversation or meme, an important usability improvement.</p>\\n<p>A much better solution for finding the most interesting memes are tools called memetrackers like Techmeme, Google News, Tailrank, Megite, and others. These memetrackers automatically find the most interesting content bubbling up in the blogosphere. Using these memetrackers, individual news readers can find in minutes the best content from 1000s of sources.</p>\\n<p>As the principle tech memetracker, Techmeme plays a hugely influential role in the tech community. Techmeme is the place to find conversation about the biggest tech memes of the day.</p>\\n<p>But at the moment there are only commercial memetrackers such as Techmeme. There are no free or open-source implementations and certainly nothing that can be easily plugged into Drupal.</p>\\n<p>My proposal then is to write a memetracker module that will fulfill the same role as Techmeme does to the tech community for any community for which it is installed. My module will intelligently filter and group community generated content to display to the community in real time the most interesting conversations and memes as they emerge.</p>\\n<h3>Potential users of my module can be placed in a few classes:</h3>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Those building community sites using Drupal. They face the same problem I related in my story earlier – how to help their users sift through new content and to find interesting conversations to follow and join in.</li>\\n<li>Those who want to build sites that support an existing online community. They would use <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/feedapi\\\">FeedAPI</a> to pull content from any number of relevant sources and then use memetracker to display interesting content and conversations from that community.</li>\\n<li>Users who use Memetracker as a personal news aggregator. They’d add news sources they are interested in and memetracker would learn their interests and filter and display only the news they are interested in.</li>\\n<li>Organizations who use Memetracker as an internal news gathering application pulling together content created by employees internally and outside news that’s of interest to the company.</li>\\n<li>Those who want to create a sitemap-like page for their site. Memetracker would create a page that showed all content ever created on the site and group by meme and order by popularity.</li>\\n<li>Organizations who want to create a branded news site. <a href=\\\"http://www.utahtechcouncil.org/\\\">Utah Tech Council</a> could put up a memetracker aggregating local newspapers and blogs that discuss Utah technology news. The <a href=\\\"http://www.savethedolphins.org/\\\">Save the Dolphins Foundation</a> could aggregate dolphin news from different news sources. Memetracker would help these organizations by drawing repeat visitors to view the aggregated content. It would be an advantage to Drupal as more sites would use Drupal to use the memetracking functionality.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The memetracker module will be especially useful to open source communities. Open source projects rely entirely on internet communication technologies to coordinate their efforts. Many commentators have linked the explosion of the open source to the opening of the Internet to the general population. Memetracking and aggregation sites in general are another step in the evolution of communication technologies on the internet. My memetracker module will allow any open source community, large or small, to put up a simple Drupal site and start aggregating developer blogs, forums, mailing lists, etc. into a centralized place.</p>\\n<h3>Another analogy: memetracker = smart aggregator:</h3>\\n<p>An aggregator is software like <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/planet\\\">Drupal Planet</a> or <a href=\\\"http://www.planetplanet.org/\\\">PlanetPlanet</a> that aggregates related content from many sources to display in a central location. But current aggregators are dumb. The dumb aggregator knows no better than to pull in new content and order it chronologically.</p>\\n<p>A memetracker is a smart aggregator. It also knows how to pull in new content as a dumb aggregator but it’s much smarter about how it displays the content. It can analyze the text of the content and know which authors are talking about the same topic and then group them together. But not only will the smart aggregator group similar topics but it will also learn what topics and authors are most interesting to members of the community and display those first. No more will you have to scroll through a long list of content skipping over content you’re not interested in but instead, new content will be nicely organized by meme and interestingness in a neat compact form.</p>\\n<h2>Project Details:</h2>\\n<p>To help you understand how the memetracker will work, I’ll walk through the steps the memetracker will take from first aggregating new content to finally outputting a view to the user.</p>\\n<h3>High level overview:</h3>\\n<p>The memetracker will assemble content from two sources (internal content through Drupal and external content through FeedAPI). It will then analyze the content to identify active memes. Then, using what the memetracker has learned from the click history, the memetracker will decide which memes to display and which to discard and which order to place the memes on the page (i.e. the most interesting memes will be at the top). UI code will be written to display the memes in an easy-to-browse fashion.</p>\\n<h3>Detailed Overview:</h3>\\n<p>A particular memetracker is tracking 100 sources (30 are blogs on the Drupal installation and 70 are various blogs and other news sources you are aggregating with FeedAPI). In the past two days, the 100 sources have created 300 pieces of content. The first pass through the 300 pieces of content will be to find memes. First it will check for interlinking between content – this indicates they are discussing the same meme. Second it will perform textual analysis on the titles, bodies, and tags of content to determine how “close” text is to each other (cluster analysis).</p>\\n<p>In my example, say the algorithm identifies 10 meme clusters in the 300 pieces of content. 80 of the 300 pieces of content are part of the 10 meme clusters leaving 220 individual memes, not associated with any other content.</p>\\n<p>You’ve set the memetracker to only display ~50 memes at a time as the memetracker is tracking a smaller community. This means the memetracker has to discard 250 links from the display page. It does this filtering by various means.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>The memetracker is biased toward keeping meme clusters (remember the goal is to display the most interesting content – if two people thought a meme worth writing about, odds are that meme is more interesting to the general community than a meme that only one person talked about) So the memetracker will weight meme clusters higher.</li>\\n<li>It will use a form of authority ranking for the different sources. If one blogger consistently writes interesting content that many people click on to read, then the memetracker will rank any new content by that blogger higher than new content by a less interesting blogger.</li>\\n<li>You’ll filter out topics not interesting to the community. Baysian logic is a possible way to do this. Baysian logic is often used for spam filtering. So just as spam filters learn that emails with “XXX” or “Hot chicks” probably are spam. If the community consistently clicks to read content about Drupal and not Plone, a new article about Drupal will be displayed and the Plone article won’t.</li>\\n<li>The meme tracker will use click momentum. By this I mean it’ll take a measure of how many times the content has been clicked on in the last while. If an article is being clicked on a lot, that suggests the article is more interesting to the community and should be moved up on the page.</li>\\n<li>I will implement a hook that will let other modules set simple rules to affect the filtering and ordering of memes. For example, if content from one source must always be displayed, say blog entries from the CEO (regardless of how interesting the CEO’s blog actually is), you could set a rule that content from this source will always be kept and not filtered out.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>So once the memetracker has grouped and filtered content down to the proper level. It’ll pass data to the UI code to be rendered and pushed out to the browser.</p>\\n<h3>Viewing Memes:</h3>\\n<p>There will be two ways (initially) to view memes. First via meme browsing pages that admins define or via custom views of data exposed by memetracker.</p>\\n<p>Admins will be able to define meme browsing pages in a process similar to creating a new panel page. When creating a new meme browsing page, you will define the page url, what sources to include (different Drupal content types, external sources from FeedAPI), and a number of settings for the page such as how long to keep old memes before refreshing and the number of memes to display at a time.</p>\\n<p>Individual meme browsing pages will look similar to Techmeme with main articles, discussion, and related content:</p>\\n<p>Screenshot from <a href=\\\"http://techmeme.com\\\">Techmeme</a> – My memetracker UI will look similar.<a href=\\\"http://techmeme.com\\\"></a><a href=\\\"http://techmeme.com\\\">2</a></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./techmeme.png\\\" alt=\\\"techmeme example\\\"></p>\\n<h3>How is memetracker different from other content recommendation engines on Drupal?</h3>\\n<p>There is some overlap in functionality but a large difference is in purpose. <a href=\\\"http://http//www.civicactions.com/blog/similar_content_module_wrapup\\\">Other content recommendation engines for Drupal</a> recommend similar or related content in the context of a single node. Memetracker also recommends content but en masse. It focuses on conversations – what are people saying now about all the current hot topics. Not what did someone say about the topic of the current node six months or two years ago.</p>\\n<h3>How will the memetracker learn to filter and group memes?</h3>\\n<p>The SoC application template asks what aspects of my proposal depend on further research or experiments. The machine learning portion of my proposal, much more than any other part fits this criteria. Machine learning is actively researched and many algorithms are now well understood. However, deciding on the correct algorithms that will fit the constraints of a web application (fast response times, low resource usage) will take considerable research and experimentation. But while the specifics are still unknown, the general direction I’ll take is clear.</p>\\n<p>The general machine learning technique I’ll use is called <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning\\\">reinforcement learning</a>. Reinforcement learning is that the algorithm learns by making a guess and then gets feedback. If the guess is good, that “state” of the algorithm is reinforced, if the guess is bad, that “state” is weakened. The algorithm gradually learns what states are most appropriate to a given situation. So in the case of the memetracker, it will guess what memes are interesting to the community and what order to place the memes on the page. Then based on feedback from the community (i.e. if links are clicked on or not clicked on) the memetracker will learn gradually how to select and display the most interesting content.</p>\\n<p>There are two major machine learning problems to be solved. Filtering out uninteresting content and clustering or grouping content into memes.</p>\\n<p>When filtering, the machine learning algorithm basically has to answer the question, will this piece of content on this topic written by this author be of sufficient interest to the general community to include on the Meme Browsing page? There are a number of algorithms that I’ve looked at to answer this question including <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier\\\">naïve bayes</a>, <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation\\\">backpropegation</a>, and <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine\\\">support vector machines</a>. Each will filter adequately for the memetrackers needs, the question to answer is which will perform best.</p>\\n<p>The second machine learning problem, clustering or grouping content into memes is more straight forward to solve. I’ll use a technique called <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_clustering#Agglomerative_hierarchical_clustering\\\">agglomerative clustering</a>. This algorithm starts with each piece of content as part of its own meme. It then determines if individual memes are actually part of a larger meme. To do this you set a “closeness” threshold. If two individual memes are closer than the threshold, the two memes are joined together into a single meme. The algorithm loops through the content joining small memes into larger memes until no two memes are closer than the “closeness” threshold.</p>\\n<p>Using the above two techniques plus reinforcement learning will create a memetracking system that adapts itself to the needs of the community it supports.</p>\\n<p>In implementing these algorithms, I’ll have the support of the excellent machine learning faculty in the Computer Science department at Brigham Young University. I’ve talked to one professor extensively about my proposal and he (and most likely one of the other professors and several graduate students) is willing to mentor me as I write the machine learning code.</p>\\n<h2>Deliverables:</h2>\\n<p>These will be my deliverables at the end of the summer:</p>\\n<h3>PHP library of Machine learning algorithms:</h3>\\n<p>I will write the machine learning algorithms as a PHP library. The library won’t be coupled to Drupal so will be portable to other open source PHP projects.</p>\\n<h3>Machine_learningAPI module:</h3>\\n<p>This module will provide a wrapper for the machine learning algorithm library.</p>\\n<h3>Memetracker module:</h3>\\n<p>This module will have several major components:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Meme browsing UI – this will be the primary view for browsing memes. It will be refreshed each cron run with new content.</li>\\n<li>Panels-like meme browsing page creator – You will be able to create any number of memebrowsing pages. When you create a new memebrowsing page, you set how long memes stay active, you set how many memes to show, and can weight the display / ranking of memes in a variety of ways.</li>\\n<li>Two hooks:\\n<ul>\\n<li>The first hook will allow other modules to modify how content is ranked. I gave an example in the project details section of how a company could modify the score of their CEO’s blog. Another potential use case is an ecommerce store might analyze content for text that mentioned their products and rank those higher.</li>\\n<li>The second hook will allow other modules to add functionality to meme browsing pages. Modules would define little ajax buttons to be added next to memes. There could be for example a send article to friend button, a save to delicious button, a bookmark button, a digg button, and other buttons that let you interact with the content.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Set of APIs</h3>\\n<p>To expose metadata about memes.</p>\\n<h3>Views integration:</h3>\\n<p>(<a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/10276#comment-33064\\\">Catch and Bill gave some suggestions on how to do this</a>)</p>\\n<h3>Documentation:</h3>\\n<p>I will write documentation for developers explaining how to use the two hooks and documentation for website operators explaining how to configure and set up a memetracker on their site.</p>\\n<h3>Tests:</h3>\\n<p>I will write a complete set of tests for the memetracker and machinelearningapi modules</p>\\n<h2>Project Schedule:</h2>\\n<p>I’m done with classes by the end of April and plan to start working on GsoC immediately. In the first 2-3 weeks of May, I will write a very rough version of the UI and machine learning code.</p>\\n<p>In the spirit of release early, release often, I will install memetracker on a public facing website. I will then put together many many memetracker pages to track different communities of bloggers and other online communities. I’ll create memetrackers for econ bloggers / liberal bloggers / conservative bloggers / edubloggers / content from the Drupal community / content on the Joomla community / Ubuntu bloggers / and many more.</p>\\n<p>My goal is to get lots of attention from these different communities so as many people start regularly using the memetrackers. Achieving high traffic is key as it will enable me to rapidly test my algorithms and iterate through 100s of variations of the machine learning algorithms. Also, building memetrackers for many types of online communities will ensure my algorithms will work well over a wide variety of content and community types.</p>\\n<p>I’ll be working mostly on improving the machine learning algorithms through the latter part of May and all of June. By the end of June I hope to have gotten the machine learning code to a very mature state.</p>\\n<p>From there I will turn my efforts to bug fixing, filling out test coverage, documentation, and improvements on the admin UI and meme browsing UI.</p>\\n<h2>Risk of failure:</h2>\\n<p>Low. Writing a working memetracker is not difficult. The devil, as they say, is in the details. Building a great memetracker is a very difficult task. I won’t have built a great memetracker by the end of the summer. Instead, my plan is to lay the foundation and build many of the necessary pieces so that with these pieces and a great deal of refining, eventually great memetrackers can be built. But I fully expect to have an adequate memetracker working at the end of the summer that will meet my needs and many others.</p>\\n<p>If writing this module does prove more difficult than I anticipated, I will limit the scope by cutting first the second hook, and then the views integration. Both of these are very nice features but not essential to creating a working memetracker.</p>\\n<h2>Biography:</h2>\\n<p>Hello Drupliers. My name is Kyle Mathews and I’m passionate about social software. I love to create software/web sites that help people connect, learn, and work together. I’m a grad student in Information Systems at Brigham Young University working as a research assistant to several faculty members. We are studying how and where social software can be used in education.</p>\\n<p>For my major, I’ve taken classes on programming, database, systems analysis, and project management. I’ve studied Java and Python at school and learned PHP while working with Drupal. I use open source full time. I’ve run Linux (Ubuntu) on my laptop full-time for the past two-years. Open source fascinates me both as a user and as a researcher of online communities and organizational behavior.</p>\\n<p>Some other experience. I wrote a web application in Java last summer for <a href=\\\"http://novell.com\\\">Novell</a>. The application queried a number of large databases and assembled and displayed information for a variety of reports used by a marketing team. I was the only developer working on the project and it took most of the summer to write working part-time.</p>\\n<p>A bit about how how I became involved with the Drupal community and the path that led me to now apply for Google Summer of Code.</p>\\n<p>I first used Drupal a year and a half ago. I debated for several months whether I liked Drupal or Joomla better before settling on Drupal. Drupal’s clean architecture was the deciding factor. I built my first production website last year using the Ubercart e-commerce module to sell t-shirts for a company some friends and I started.</p>\\n<p>My involvement and understanding in Drupal started to advance last summer when I started working as a research assistant at BYU. Since starting that job, I’ve built a number of classroom websites using Drupal (<a href=\\\"http://isyscore.byu.edu/drupal/\\\">isyscore</a>, <a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/8610\\\">web analytics site</a>, <a href=\\\"http://island.byu.edu\\\">g.d.o. like site for all Information Systems students</a>) wearing down my copy of “Pro Drupal Development” in the process. I’ve learned a considerable bit about Drupal in the past year and a half, became very involved in the community, and am writing a module (<a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/writing_assignment\\\">writing_assignment</a> – still a work in progress btw). I’ve loved most everything about Drupal but wish Drupal could do memetracking, an important component for building the perfect social learning website. This itches. So, in the best open-source fashion, I’m applying to Google Summer of Code to scratch my itch.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-04-04---drupal-memetracker-module-my-google-summer-of-code-application/index.md\n ** module id = 441\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Assorted Links\",\"tags\":[\"blogging\",\"elearning2.0\",\"enterprise2.0\",\"innovation\"],\"date\":\"2008-04-17T18:43:26.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I think I’m going to start doing “link posts” more often.

This contrasts with most classroom learning activities which involve knowledge which is abstract and out of context. Social interaction is a critical component of situated learning – learners become involved in a “community of practice” which embodies certain beliefs and behaviors to be acquired. As the beginner or newcomer moves from the periphery of this community to its center, they become more active and engaged within the culture and hence assume the role of expert or old-timer. Furthermore, situated learning is usually unintentional rather than deliberate. These ideas are what Lave &amp; Wenger (1991) call the process of “legitimate peripheral participation.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.socialtext.net/stanfordsocialmedia/index.cgi?syllabus\\\">Syllabus for Virtual community/social media class at Stanford</a> – Loads of links to great resources.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.cognitive-edge.com/2006/10/they_did_not_respect_or_sit_st.php\\\">Learn the difference between states of order and unorder – a birthday story</a></p>\\n<p>One of the most profound insights into management I’ve read.

And I’ve thought a lot about it. Why I want to learn, how I learn best, and why it seems I often don’t learn. It’s an often quoted piece of wisdom that you learn the most when you fail. In the same way, you can improve the quality of your work on something by examining what parts you do poorly and improving those. As that is where your model or methodolgy for doing whatever is breaking down.</p>\\n<p>Schooling has long been the least productive source of learning for me. College, thankfully, does much better then high school – therefore somewhat justifying the thousands of dollars they take from me each year. but still has weaknesses.</p>\\n<p>I started reading a fascinating book this morning called “The Cluetrain”[add link]. What it was about is a subject for a different blog post, however it brought up the old irritiation I have with schools. Teaching done at school has several problems. Slow methods of learning - lecture, poorly motivated students that most be spoon-fed knowledge and/or students so drunken[think of better word] by schooling system that doesn’t encourage in the slightest independent learning/thinking that they can’t learn by themselves, and/or professors that don’t teach well.</p>\\n<p>I measure learning by “ah hah” moments. Those times, when your reading or thinking about something and the pieces come together and your understanding crystalizes. These are like little shots of drugs to keep me going. It seems these moments come few and far between at school and much more often when learning by myself or with other like-minded people.</p>\\n<p>Why? I learn things faster so often bored when professor going over things I already understand. Talking very slow way of transmiting knowledge as compared to reading. biggest thing to me is perspective.</p>\\n<p>We learn things by looking at stuff from different perspectives. How often is there something you know, think you understand it very well but then talk to someone who understands it differently [think of concrete example] and all of a sudden you understand it so much better.</p>\\n<p>It’s the difference between 2D and 3D. It’s like the difference on a movie between a static shot and a sweeping panoramic shot of a say a house. It’s the difference between trying to figure the height of a house from one [what is an example that people commonly grapple with or have experienced?] shot or 20 from all different angles and distances.</p>\\n<p>If you only read liberal or conservative political commentary, how well will you truely understand issuies as compared to reading from a variety of sources?</p>\\n<p>Professors only teach from one side of an issuie most of the time whether purposely or not. It’s hard to understand. Learning about project management. Textbook/professor has authoritative this is how it is. No nuance no subtiltiy. Just from my own little expereince in world know most projects aren’t managed like that.</p>\\n<p>Being a bit unfair. What I’m learning does have some practical value. It just seems it’s undigested. I get this big ball of knowledge thrown in my lap and I have to do the hard work of unravelinging it and making connections from it. It seems to me that something well-written books and excellent teaching have in common is they help you make connections. The World Wide <em>Web</em> is an excellent way of organizing information because it mimics how our brains stores and processes information. Think about the last time you had or read a really exciting idea. It explodes in your mind. Immediately you mind races making connections, oh, that is like this, that explains better this process, we can use that to improve such-and-such that we are doing.</p>\\n<p>I like to think of our brain as an intricate web of little nuggets of knowledge with thousands of connections strewn between them forming uncountable number of connections. As we think and reason, we sail along the webs between all the different knowledge and experiences we’ve had and build up a whatever.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-05-17---school-and-learning/index.md\n ** module id = 450\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Ubuntu meta-packages website\",\"date\":\"2008-05-17T15:12:59.000Z\",\"draft\":true,\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I watched the recent introduction of ubuntu-studio recently with great interest.

For my dream to become reality, Memetracker will need help from many talented developers. This summer I’ll be setting a solid foundation for future development of the memetracker module. One important thing I’ll be doing is writing unit tests for all the functions of the memetracker. Unit tests, I’m convinced, is one thing Memetracker needs in order to ensure its long term success.</p>\\n<p>Unit tests are at the heart of <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\\\">Test Driven Development (TDD)</a>. TDD and unit tests when used have been shown to improve the quality of code and reduce bugs and regressions (see this <a href=\\\"http://www.lullabot.com/articles/introduction-unit-testing\\\">excellent post</a> by <a href=\\\"http://robshouse.net/\\\">Robert Douglass</a> for a full introduction to unit testing).</p>\\n<p>My brother <a href=\\\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminmathews\\\">Ben</a> is a software engineer and has long preached to me the benefits of unit tests and TDD. When I started programming Memetracker, I agreed in principle with the benefits of unit tests but as I wanted to see something working more than write boring test code, I just dived into the coding without writing any unit tests. But as the lines of code accumulated and the complexity grew, weird bugs started cropping up and having a solid coverage of unit tests as a safety net started sounding better and better.</p>\\n<p>So I stopped coding and spent a day studying unit testing and <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/simpletest\\\">SimpleTest</a> (the testing framework Drupal uses). There was a painful learning curve to wrap my head around the concepts but just a few days of coding with unit tests has made me a convert.</p>\\n<p>A quick example of how SimpleTest has helped me improve the quality of my code.</p>\\n<p>Memetracker tries to present to readers the most interesting memes (conversations around a topic) to readers on a web page. To learn which memes are interesting, Memetracker records the articles people click on from the memebrowsing page. By counting clicks, memetracker can calculate an interestingness score for the different memes and from that score, determine which memes to display and in what order.</p>\\n<p>When a person clicks on a article, that information is sent from the browser to the memetracker module. In memetracker.module is a function, memetracker_set_click(), which saves the click information to a table in the database.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to make sure this function works correctly so I wrote a unit test which sent a fake click to the memetracker_set_click function and then tested that the click was actually saved to the database.</p>\\n<p>So I wrote the test. . . and it worked!</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/82268668@N00/2625633427/\\\" title=\\\"click_test by kylenumber5, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"./2625633427_4fa80978a2_o.png\\\" alt=\\\"click_test\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>But wait a second – I thought – it shouldn’t of worked. To save the click data a memetracker object has to be loaded which then does the actual saving of the click information. But when I wrote the unit test, I had made up an id for the memetracker object. All information for different memetracker objects are stored in the database (one website can have multiple memetrackers). If a memetracker didn’t exist in the database, it shouldn’t be loaded.</p>\\n<p>I had already written some code to validate that a memetracker object existed before loading but somehow that validation wasn’t working. I looked at the validation code and quickly found the problem. Problem solved, and to ensure this didn’t happen again I wrote a new unit test to ensure my validation code works correctly in the future.</p>\\n<p>Unit tests are valuable for any coding project longer than a few lines. Once you get past the learning curve, writing new tests are easy. And it’s a great feeling after making changes to run my tests and know in seconds everything is still working as it should.</p>\\n<p>To learn more about unit testing, read <a href=\\\"http://www.lullabot.com/about/angiebyron\\\">Angie Bryon’s (webchick)</a> great blog post about how <a href=\\\"http://www.lullabot.com/articles/drupal-module-developer-guide-simpletest\\\">unit tests let you to refactor without fear</a>.

It also knows how to pull in new content as a dumb aggregator but it’s much smarter about how it displays the content. It can analyze the text of the content and know which authors are talking about the same topic and then group them together. But not only will the smart aggregator group similar topics but it will also learn what topics and authors are most interesting to members of the community and display those first. No more will you have to scroll through a long list of content skipping over content you’re not interested in but instead, new content will be nicely organized by meme and interestingness in a neat compact form.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>To join in the work of building an open source memetracker, join the <a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org/memetracker\\\">Memetracker group</a> at <a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org\\\">groups.drupal.org</a>.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-07-01---announcing-first-alpha-release-drupal-memetracker-module/index.md\n ** module id = 455\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"What is the key metric to measure Learning2.0?\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"elearning2.0\",\"Learning\",\"conversation\",\"byu\"],\"date\":\"2008-07-18T21:57:59.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>This was a comment I left on Jon Mott’s blog post, <a href=\\\"http://www.jonmott.com/blog/?p=17#comment-937077\\\">Getting From Here to There</a>. Jon is an Academic Technology Strategist here at <a href=\\\"http://byu.edu\\\">BYU</a> who shares my enthusiasm for using web2.0 tools in the classroom.</p>\\n<p>I think a critical tool to have in building and proselytizing learning 2.0 tools is a key metric. This metric would be used to guide building decisions and to measure success.</p>\\n<p>In the book “Good to Great”, an important event in the transitions of good companies to great companies was identifying a key metric or denominator as the book calls it.</p>\\n<p>The process of picking and using this denominator served as a mechanism to push deeper understanding of the company’s economic engine. The companies asked themselves this question &quot;If we could only pick one and only one ratio – profit per x – to systematically increase over time, what x would have the greatest and most sustainable impact on our economic engine?</p>\\n<p>Wells Fargo went through this process during bank deregulation:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>“Consider Wells Fargo. When the Wells team confronted the brutal fact that deregulation would transform banking into a commodity, they realized that standard banker metrics, like profit per loan and profit per deposit, would no longer be the key drivers. Instead, they grasped a new denominator: <em>profit per employee</em>. Following this logic, Wells Fargo became one of the first banks to change its distribution to rely primarily on stripped-down branches and ATMs.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Because Wells Fargo understood their key economic drivers, they were able to a) encapsulate this logic through identifying a new denominator and b) use this logic to make many highly successful changes.</p>\\n<p>So my question is what are the key drivers of BYU’s (and other school’s) learning engine? What denominator or key metric offers the best insight as we plan / build / measure / proselyte new online technologies in education?</p>\\n<p>My suggestion would be conversations on learning topics per student per day.</p>\\n<p>I love Robert Scoble’s (social media figure) goal to <a href=\\\"http://scobleizer.com/2008/04/10/not-productive-enough-turn-off-the-internet/\\\">have an interesting conversation every day</a>. Conversations with others seems an important key to learning almost anything.</p>\\n<p>My best educational experience by far here at BYU was the Information Systems Junior Core – It’s 24 credits over two semesters. I was placed in a group of four and spent eight hours a week sitting next to my group members. Almost all of our projects were group projects and those that weren’t we often ended up working together anyways. Everything about the core was designed to push us students to talk to one another. A mailing list was set up for the ~110 students in the core. It saw heavy usage with students asking / answering questions about all sorts of class / ISys related questions.</p>\\n<p>The effect of all this was conversation, lots of it. Because of these conversations (and great professors / projects) I learned far more and I had much more fun than in other classes here. We talked so much about ISys / non ISys topics that many of us became good friends. I looked forward to class because I was going to see my friends.</p>\\n<p>By comparison, in most other classes I learn in isolation. I don’t get to know other students very well so I don’t talk much with them about the subject so I learn less and the class is much more boring.</p>\\n<p>My take on all this is we learn best with friends who are striving to become what we are striving to become.</p>\\n<p>Obviously not every classroom experience at BYU can hope to replicate what’s done in the ISys Junior Core but I think much could be improved. The types of assignments given (e.g. more group work) and the integration of social software tools that make it easier for students and professors to connect online and offline would do much to help more conversations happen at BYU which would dramatically increase the quality and quantity of education.</p>\\n<p>What do you all think?</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-07-18---what-key-metric-measure-learning20/index.md\n ** module id = 456\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"My educational philosophy\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"entrepreneurship\",\"Learning\"],\"date\":\"2008-09-10T14:43:20.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>A book I read recently helped me finger out why school can be so irritating at times.</p>\\n<p>The book is entitled <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Weird-Ideas-That-Work-Sustaining/dp/0743212126\\\">Weird Ideas that Work: 11 1/2 Practices for Promoting, Managing, and Sustaining Innovation</a>. One of its “weird ideas” is that companies should hire slow learners. Not stupid people but slow learners of the organization’s code. A code is, the author explains, “a company’s ‘knowledge and faiths,’ its history, memories, procedures, precedents, rules, and all those taken-for-granted, and often unspoken, assumptions about why things are supposed to be done in certain ways.”</p>\\n<p>He goes on to say that most companies hire “fast learners” who quickly learn to do things the “right way” and see things much as others do in the company. But companies that do innovative work need a different kind of worker, one who won’t get “brainwashed into thinking just like everyone else. They need people who avoid, ignore, or reject ‘the heat of the herd. . .’”</p>\\n<p>How do you find this sort of person? One suggestion he made is to hire smart people with bad grades. He says research has shown that many creative geniuses–including Edison and Darwin–were poor students.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Creativity researcher Dean Keith Simonton points out: “To obtain high marks in school often requires a high degree of conformity to conventional ways of looking at the world and people.” People who get good grades are often fast learners of social cues. By contrast, smart people who get bad grades are listening to their inner voice, doing <em>what they believe is interesting and right</em>. Simonton observes that “one of the reasons creative talents often dislike school is that it can interfere with <em>what they really want to know</em>. When faced with the choice of reading a good book or studying for an exam, the extracurricular but still instructive diversion may win out.” [italics mine]</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>School irritates me because I’m often told by teachers to do things and learn things I don’t think are valuable. I have strong opinions about where I’m going and what I need to know to get there. When demands from school align with my own interests, things go well. But when they clash, school loses out.</p>\\n<p>One of my guiding principles is maintaining control of my own destiny. I cede control of my experiences only to those with whom I have an unusual amount of trust. The trust threshold a person must meet before I’m willing to give up control varies upon the importance of the activity but for learning especially, it is very high. There is nothing more important than what I know, what I think, and especially how I think. My thoughts are my destiny. And when I let someone influence my thoughts, my destiny partially becomes theirs. And there are very few teachers indeed with whom I want to share destinies.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-09-10---my-educational-philosophy/index.md\n ** module id = 457\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Memetracker module gets some press\",\"tags\":[\"memetracker\"],\"date\":\"2008-09-17T22:08:08.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>The <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/memetracker\\\">Memetracker module</a> I worked on this past summer for Google Summer of Code saw some press today. <a href=\\\"http://webdevnews.net/2008/09/memetracker-module-released-for-drupal/\\\">Web Dev News wrote</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>One of the most powerful and innovative modules to be developed for Drupal this year is Memetracker.

The article nails the problem with most social media / knowledge management installations in organizations.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The difficulty in most knowledge management effort lies in <em>changing organizational culture and people’s work habits</em>. It lies in getting people to <em>take the time to articulate and share the really good stuff</em>. If a group of people don’t already share knowledge, don’t already have plenty of contact, don’t already <em>understand what insights and information will be useful to each other</em>, information technology is not likely to create it. However, most knowledge management efforts treat these cultural issues as secondary, implementation issues. They typically focus on information systems–identifying what information to capture, constructing taxonomies for organizing information, determining access, and so on. <strong>The great trap in knowledge management is using information management tools and concepts to design knowledge management systems.</strong></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Sharing useful knowledge is a skill that few people learn to use effectively. The past year and a half for various reasons I’ve heavily involved myself in the <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org\\\">Drupal</a> open source community. One of the most fascinating things I’ve seen and learned from is how members of the community share knowledge. Drupal has a very effective knowledge sharing culture. What I’ve learned is that it’s the <em>people</em> that make the Drupal culture effective not so much the tools or processes that the Drupal community has created.</p>\\n<p>People who become members of open source communities love to create and share knowledge. The people who are attracted to these kinds of communities have a passion for sharing and collaboratively creating knowledge. Another difference is the incentive structures. Open source communities are <a href=\\\"http://www.communitywiki.org/en/DoOcracy\\\">do-ocracies</a>. People have power and influence within the Drupal community because they <em>do</em> something. They write code, they write documentation, they answer questions in the forums, and so on. People who <em>do</em> things get the respect and trust of their peers. In open source communities, both the people and the incentive structure encourage knowledge sharing.</p>\\n<p>So even with the twin disadvantages of using relatively unsophisticated collaboration software and that most contributors don’t work closely together; open source communities’ “knowledge management” systems stand as gleaming pillars of success next to the smoking hulks of the many multi-million dollar knowledge management systems developed and abandoned by major corporations. Any organization that wants to develop a strong knowledge sharing culture would do well to study the successes of the many open source communities. Organizations must find or develop the right kind of people and create the right incentive structures.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-09-26---its-culture-some-insights-organizational-learning/index.md\n ** module id = 459\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Content Recommendation\",\"tags\":[\"memetracker\",\"drupal planet\",\"content recommendation\"],\"date\":\"2008-10-14T00:26:11.000Z\",\"draft\":true,\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>New Note 66</p>\\n<p>Each one of us wakes up everyday with a problem. A problem we must solve in order to have a successful day. The problem is finding the right information. Without the right information, we can’t choose a good breakfast, catch the bus to work, find a restaurant, call a client, buy the right stock, cook chicken noodle soup, help a child with homework or complete any of the other billion and one tasks we do daily. If the information we know is either of bad quality or missing important pieces then we are poor employees, poor parents, poor friends, and live a life far short of its potential. If we know something we can do something. On the flip side, if we don’t know something then we are unable to do something. If we don’t know the bus time or bus number, we can’t ride it to work. If we don’t know a client’s number, then we can’t call them. If we don’t know a restaurant’s number then we’re unable to eat there. This is a vitally important point. We can’t do what we don’t know. If we know little we do little.</p>\\n<p>Knowing and understanding things is a topic I’ve thought about deeply for a long time. Specifically about mechanisms we use on the individual, community and society-wide basis for identifying and propagating the most interesting and relevant news. This past summer, I worked on building an open-source memetracker for the Drupal social publishing platform as part of Google Summer of Code. Memetrackers are one technique used for creating automated news sites similar to Google News and Techmeme (see my original proposal to Google Summer of Code for more details). In this blog post I want to take a more holistic approach for examining the question of what exactly is content recommendation and why do we need it. Finally, I’ll use my analysis to make a recommendation for creating a general purpose content recommendation engine that can be implemented in Drupal (and other online systems).</p>\\n<p>We need information to live. We need content recommendation because we can’t, by ourselves, get all the information we need. How much harder would all of our lives be if each of us, individually, had to figure out the bus schedule in our city? Probably billions of man-hours are saved yearly just because one of the employees of each bus company is responsible for creating a bus schedule and posting it online or in a booklet. In a similar fashion, think how useful are books. If you were a bit curious about astronomy and wanted to learn some think how difficult it’d be, unaided, to start to grasp what astronomy is all about. Books are so convenient. An expert in the field spends several months of their life distilling the most important important information for a beginner like you. One lazy Saturday afternoon with that book and you will know more about the subject then months of stumbling about trying to understand. And how did we find information before Google? Google (and other search engines) are critical for finding that very small needle of information in the very large haystack that is the internet.</p>\\n<p>In short, we need help finding the right information; we need content recommendation. As my examples show there are times we need help because information is scare, there are times we need help because there is too much information and we need help filtering out the unneeded information so we’re left with a managable and digestable chunk. And at times, the right content is already available, we just need someone to point it out.</p>\\n<p>What kind of content recommendation tools do we already use? I already mentioned a few, books and Google. In addition we use airfare searching sites, we read magazines, we ask librarians, we watch TV, we follow blogs, we talk to friends, we go to conferences, we join community groups, we join trade groups, we attend debates, and the list goes on and on. All of these are an effort to find information that is most relevant and most interesting for our particular needs.</p>\\n<p>From thinking about all this, I’ve concluded that all content recommendation is the result of a process comprised of the following steps: filtering, organization, and display.</p>\\n<p>If our starting point is all the information in the universe and our ending goal is useful and relevant information a filter is something which removes information, an organizer is something that sorts information into categories, and a displayer is set of decisions on how to display the filtered and organized information specifically the choice of what information to emphesize (and not) and what information you’ll make easily accessible and what information you will not.</p>\\n<p>Consider the following two examples of content recommendation. I’ve broken down two content recommendation processes into their individual steps of filtering, organizing, and displaying information. The first process is the one used by my <a href=\\\"/drupal-memetracker-module-my-google-summer-of-code-application\\\">Drupal memetracker module</a> I wrote this summer. The second is the steps used by a typical US local newspaper.</p>\\n<p><strong>The Color Key</strong>:</p>\\n<p>Current state (size and type) of content</p>\\n<p><em>Filters</em> remove content</p>\\n<p><em>Organizers</em> sort content or place content into categories</p>\\n<p><em>Displays</em> are the final decision about what content you emphasize and make easily accessible. . . and what content you don’t</p>\\n<h3>Memetracker Filter Flowchart:</h3>\\n<p>Every last bit of content in the Universe</p>\\n<p>1. Filter: What content sources will be imported into memetracker?</p>\\n<p>All content imported from choosen content sources since the sources were added</p>\\n<p>2. Filter: Was the content written in the past 48 hours?</p>\\n<p>All content from online sources that was written in the past 48 hours</p>\\n<p>3. Organize: Cluster content by meme</p>\\n<p>4. Organize: Sort memes by size, age, and other factors</p>\\n<p>All content from online sources that was written in the past 48 hours now organized by meme</p>\\n<p>5. Filter: Is the meme one of the top 15?</p>\\n<p>6. All content from online sources that was written in the past 48 hours that are part of the top 15 memes</p>\\n<p>7. Display: Show headlines with related articles hidden</p>\\n<h3>Local Newspaper Filter Flowchart:</h3>\\n<p>Every last bit of content in the Universe</p>\\n<p>1. Filter: Is the content local news?</p>\\n<p>All local news from since last publication of newspaper</p>\\n<p>2. Filter: Will the content be interesting to the locals?</p>\\n<p>All local news from last publication of the newspaper that reporters/editors think will be interesting</p>\\n<p>3. Filter: What part of the news story should we include?</p>\\n<p>4. Organize: Categorize stories (politics, sports, etc.)</p>\\n<p>All interesting local news now organized by story.</p>\\n<p>5. Display: Print most important stories “above the fold”</p>\\n<p>give examples of how the following filter/organize/display content - new york times, a book, a memetracker (interlinking and link popularity), a personalized social news recommnder (like findory)</p>\\n<p>First filter by far the most important – determains charecter of filter, what this filter is – newspaper we show only local news. this memetracker is about soil erosion news in the midwestern states in the united states. Take filter from infinite possiblities to very finite. Further filtering, organizing, and display is merely a polishing process</p>\\n<p>Call these filters – organizing and display is secondary. They’re just aids to understanding filtered data but once data is gone it is gone and can’t be recreated by the consumer of the filtered content.</p>\\n<p>Every choice of how and when to filter, organize,</p>\\n<p>and display is a reflection of the filter creator’s</p>\\n<p>bias and has implications for what the consumer</p>\\n<p>of the now filtered content will understand,</p>\\n<p>belive, and do.</p>\\n<p>Initial filter follows leader intent from making it stick</p>\\n<p>Filter = remove content</p>\\n<p>organize = sort content or place content in categories</p>\\n<p>display = what content you emphesize and make easily assible. . . and what content you don’t</p>\\n<p>A small Drupal note. This model fits very well into the views paradigm. I suggest that all content recommendation modules be consolidated within the views framework. For example, memetracker would be an organizer, you could filter by how many days you wanted, sort by interestingness of memes etc.</p>\\n<p>visual of steps of filtering and organizing and displaying news</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-10-14---content-recommendation/index.md\n ** module id = 460\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Internet reduces need for experts.

In this brave new world with near ubiquitous digital knowledge, what then are professors good for?</p>\\n<p>They aren’t nearly as valuable at teaching explicit knowledge so what’s left is to teach tacit knowledge (knowledge that’s hard to learn from reading). What tacit knowledge? I’d suggest the most important tacit knowledge that professors can help students learn is how to ask the right questions in their field. How do students learn to ask the right questions? By joining and <strong>participating</strong> in communities of practice.</p>\\n<p>I see Island’s (and other web2.0 tools) greatest potential is in exposing and connecting students more easily to active participants in different communities of practice. Through this exposure and connections they can learn to emulate these experts through experiencing and doing what experts experience and do.</p>\\n<p>Good learning is learning to <strong>be</strong> something not learning <strong>about</strong> something. I might know everything a book can teach me about chemistry but still fail miserably at being a chemist. I might be able to pass every grammar test in existence but still not be able to write a sensible essay. Learning split from its context is worthless.</p>\\n<p>Some of my most valuable classes here at BYU were taught by active participants in their community of practice. By watching them practice their craft, I learned what it meant to <strong>be</strong> a member of that community and what it meant to <strong>practice</strong> that community’s craft.</p>\\n<p>So what then are professors good for? I believe as guides. They can lead students into communities of practice and can model proper behavior and attitudes. And once students are <strong>in</strong> the community of practice, professors can help students choose appropriate experiences that will help them move through the stages between novice to expert.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-10-23---internet-reduces-need-experts-where-does-leave-professors/index.md\n ** module id = 461\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Proposal for Open Studies (Un)course\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"Learning\",\"byu\",\"island\"],\"date\":\"2008-10-25T00:33:29.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>[This is the <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/content/proposal-open-studies-uncourse\\\">proposal I’m making for the creation of a new course at BYU</a>.]</p>\\n<p>Students have many different needs, one size does not fit all. In our current courses, some are appropriately challenged but many others are bored and dissatisfied. Classes are not customizable by students to meet their needs or to fit their learning styles. In addition there are many subjects students would like to learn (the long-tail of education) that there isn’t enough demand to justify allocating a classroom and teacher. Most students already spend considerable time outside of school learning things not taught in their courses. This course would give them access to resources at school most importantly their peers as they study advanced topics in small groups.</p>\\n<p>The course would be divided into three 6-week segments. In each segment, the student creates a learning project where they create both a learning goal and a learning plan. The learning plan will include the steps to reach their learning goal and a list of resources they will use which can include people and materials (books, OpenCourseWare, online resources, etc.). This learning plan will be reviewed by other students and a teacher before being passed off. Students can also “cite” other learning plans in their proposal creating a marketplace for learning plans. After learning plans are finalized, students will be organized into groups of 3-7 people who all are studying similar topics. These groups will meet weekly while students are working on their project.</p>\\n<h4>Diagram of a six-week segment.</h4>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/82268668@N00/2969785767/\\\" title=\\\"openstudies by kylenumber5, on Flickr\\\"><img src=\\\"./2969785767_ce6ff99643_b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"openstudies\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>During the segment, students will be asked to share what they are learning. Each week they’ll make a post in an Island group about helpful resources they’ve found and/or how they solved a obstacle in their project. The last week of the segment is devoted to teaching what they learned. Each student will be asked to teach in a digital form what they learned and post it on Island. This could be as simple as a blog post or as elaborate as a screencast, a video, or podcast. In addition students will be asked to participate in an Ignite session (<a href=\\\"http://ignite.oreilly.com/\\\">http://ignite.oreilly.com/</a>) and an <a href=\\\"http://www.digital-web.com/articles/understanding_the_unconference/\\\">Unconference</a>. Ignite sessions are where each presenter has 5 minutes on stage with 20 slides which rotate automatically every 15 seconds. An Unconference is a new form of conferences organized on the premise that all attendees have something valuable to say. Students will be asked to attend the unconference held the final week and either present or blog some of the presentations.</p>\\n<p>This course would produce a rapidly growing collection of valuable learning plans and learning resources useful to students and teachers alike. They will be useful to students who are taking the Open Studies class and need a good learning plan or who are studying outside of school. They will be useful teachers who are looking for new and innovative ways to help students learn.</p>\\n<p>Teachers would have a different role in the Open Studies class. They would be mentors or coaches. They would help advanced students who are passionate about a subject complete effective projects. They would help train students to be proficient, self-directed, lifelong, and wise learners.</p>\\n<p>There is a huge unmet demand for specialized classes in my major, Information Systems, and elsewhere across the BYU campus. I for one would love to take a classes on social network analysis, cloud computing, and Javascript UI design, none of which are available. I have a friend who wants to take a .NET web development class but can only find 4 other students who are interested. The Open Studies Course would meet these and other demands.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-10-25---proposal-open-studies-uncourse/index.md\n ** module id = 463\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Knight News Challenge application to improve Memetracker and Content Recommendation Engine modules\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"memetracker\",\"drupal planet\",\"knight news challenge\",\"content recommendation engine\"],\"date\":\"2008-11-02T06:47:27.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I just submitted my application to the <a href=\\\"http://www.newschallenge.org/\\\">Knight News Challenge</a>.

Memetracker, is of course, <a href=\\\"/ive-been-accepted-to-google-summer-of-code\\\">the module I wrote this past summer</a> as part of <a href=\\\"http://code.google.com/soc/2008/\\\">Google Summer of Code</a>.</p>\\n<h3>Title:</h3>\\n<p>Improve modules for semi-automated news aggregation and content recommendation in Drupal</p>\\n<h3>Describe your project:</h3>\\n<p>All organizations, large and small, have a vital need to deliver relevant and timely information to its members. My project will be to make it possible for organizations to easily meet this need. I will work on two Drupal modules, write documentation, and build a Drupal install profile so that organizations can easily add sophisticated news aggregation and recommendation tools into their Drupal website.</p>\\n<p>The two Drupal modules I will improve are Memetracker and Content Recommendation Engine.</p>\\n<p>I wrote Memetracker as part of the 2008 Google Summer of Code. The Memetracker module uses machine learning algorithms to intelligently filter and group all types of content. The module’s purpose is to find and display to a community in real time the most interesting conversations and memes on relevant topics as they emerge.</p>\\n<p>My goal for the memetracker module is for it emulate functionality of successful commercial memetrackers such as Techmeme, Google News, Tailrank, and Megite. I want it to be a robust open-source implementation of memetracking technology that can be easily plugged into Drupal-based community sites.</p>\\n<p>The Content Recommendation Engine module is designed to provide personalized content recommendation. It learns what types of content individuals are interested in and recommends new content as it comes in.</p>\\n<p>Both modules are powerful ideas but need quite a bit of work to be usable in real-life situations. I would use the Knight Foundation money to do fix bugs, add requested functionality, and to create an install profile which makes it very easy for non-technical end-users to install a sophisticated Drupal-based news aggregation and recommendation site.</p>\\n<h3>How will your project improve the way news and information are delivered to geographic communities?</h3>\\n<p>There are many tools available to communities to aggregate and distribute information. What’s missing are open source tools which leverage not just human intelligence to filter content but also artificial intelligence.</p>\\n<p>There is far too much information for any person or organization to sort through manually. These automated tools can be thought of as pre-processors that improve the signal-to-noise ratio reducing the stress people endure trying to follow news. By filtering out the noise, important news is much more likely to be identified and acted upon.</p>\\n<h3>How is your idea innovative? (new or different from what already exists)</h3>\\n<p>There are not any open source tools that do the automated content filtering and recommendation these two tools will do. In addition, the few tools that are similar to these are standalone applications where as my work would be built on Drupal, the most widely used open-source social publishing platform. This means two things. First, my tools would get wider adoption as they would fit into many organization’s existing technology stack. Second, they are more useful as they can take advantage of many other powerful modules available for Drupal. The tools will be the basic building blocks of a rich flowering of content aggregation / filtering web applications based on these modules and Drupal.</p>\\n<h3>What experience do you or your organization have to successfully develop this project?</h3>\\n<p>I was a <a href=\\\"/drupal-memetracker-module-my-google-summer-of-code-application\\\">Google Summer of Code student</a> this past summer where I wrote the Memetracker module.</p>\\n<p>I traveled to Drupalcon in Hungary and presented there on the Memetracker module and on content filtering in general. The session and Q&amp;A can be viewed here:</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.archive.org/details/memtracker\\\">http://www.archive.org/details/memtracker</a></p>\\n<p>Currently I’m building and maintaining a large Drupal-based social learning platform at Brigham Young University. As I develop tools for the site and work with and observe the 100s of student users (soon to be thousands), I’m developing a deep understanding of how information spreads though a community and how to develop technology to facilitate that process. I hope to use both modules extensively in this website. The social learning website can be viewed here: <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu\\\">https://island.byu.edu</a></p>\\n<p>I have been heavily involved in the Drupal community for the past 1.5 years. From this experience, I have obtained a good understanding about how open source development works and am confident I will be able to build these tools such that they are easily modified and extensible to meet the varying needs of different organizations.</p>\\n<p>I am passionate about building tools that help organizations digest, interact around, and act upon information. I would very much appreciate support from the Knight Foundation to continue to improve the Memetracker and the Content Recommendation Engine modules and make them widely available.

The teachers were reporting on their experiences in teaching a course on creativity to freshmen college students. They reported on some things that happened and we did some of the exercises they do in their classes. I was disappointed though as the session leaders focused on teaching the <em>behaviors</em> of creative people while completely missing what’s driving these behaviors.</p>\\n<p>Love is at the heart of all creative acts.</p>\\n<p>I can think of three reasons.</p>\\n<p>A creative thought is just another word for an excellent thought. Most ideas are average. Most people settle for ideas that are “good enough.” And why not? Thinking is hard and if the first idea that comes along is “good enough”, why not use it? But if you truly love something, you can’t settle for “good enough.” Think of any great athlete. They are great because their love for the game pushes them to practice more than comparable athletes. Any great artist, musician, architect is driven by their <em>passion</em> for the art. Even in fields not normally considered “creative”, the best in that field are the best because of their love for their craft. They do great and creative things because their love for their work pushes them beyond the “good enough.”</p>\\n<p>Fear of failure drives people to be average. Fear of failure recedes as hope, driven by love, takes its place. Most people are driven primarily by fear. They settle for the “safe” answer. They do the sure thing, take the safe job, do what pleases the client, etc. People who love something <em>can’t</em> settle on what’s safe as anything but the best for their beloved is not acceptable. Creative people, driven by love, behave recklessly in the eyes of their “saner” cousins.</p>\\n<p>People who love something pay attention to what they love. If you pay attention to something, you will soon know much more about the thing you love than those who don’t pay attention to it. By knowing more about this thing you will soon have better ideas on how to improve this thing than someone who doesn’t love this thing. A parent who loves their children will talk and play with them and get to know them and by knowing them better becomes a better parent. A teacher who loves their students will learn their sometimes hidden strengths and weaknesses and learn how to nurture each in the way most suited. And the same is every case you can imagine. The man who loves his town will pay attention to it and soon have better, more creative, ideas on how to improve it. What I find remarkable about people who don’t seem to love is how little</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-11-29---love-fountain-all-creativity/index.md\n ** module id = 465\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Process is an embedded reaction to prior stupidity\",\"tags\":[\"process\"],\"date\":\"2008-11-30T02:39:36.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Since I read this quote by Clay Shirky, “<a href=\\\"http://many.corante.com/archives/2003/09/17/process_is_an_embedded_reaction_to_prior_stupidity.php\\\">process is an embedded reaction to prior stupidity</a>” it’s been at the top of my very long Shirky quote list. For someone like me who thrives on doing things, bureaucracy is a nightmare.</p>\\n<p>Another of my favorite authors, Paul Graham, wrote a great essay along the same vein today, talking about the <a href=\\\"http://www.paulgraham.com/artistsship.html\\\">gradual build-up of checks and processes</a> and the very real cost those checks impose upon all of us.</p>\\n<p>Some of my favorite parts:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>One of the differences between big companies and startups is that big companies tend to have developed procedures to protect themselves against mistakes. A startup walks like a toddler, bashing into things and falling over all the time. A big company is more deliberate.</p>\\n<p>The gradual accumulation of checks in an organization is a kind of learning, based on disasters that have happened to it or others like it. After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankrupt and fails to deliver, for example, a company might require all suppliers to prove they’re solvent before submitting bids.</p>\\n<p>As companies grow they invariably get more such checks, either in response to disasters they’ve suffered, or (probably more often) by hiring people from bigger companies who bring with them customs for protecting against new types of disasters.</p>\\n<p>It’s natural for organizations to learn from mistakes. The problem is, people who propose new checks almost never consider that the check itself has a cost.</p>\\n<p>…</p>\\n<p>Whenever someone in an organization proposes to add a new check, they should have to explain not just the benefit but the cost. No matter how bad a job they did of analyzing it, this meta-check would at least remind everyone there had to be a cost, and send them looking for it.</p>\\n<p>If companies started doing that, they’d find some surprises. Joel Spolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling software to corporate customers. He said that in most companies software costing up to about $1000 could be bought by individual managers without any additional approvals. Above that threshold, software purchases generally had to be approved by a committee. But babysitting this process was so expensive for software vendors that it didn’t make sense to charge less than $50,000. Which means if you’re making something you might otherwise have charged $5000 for, you have to sell it for $50,000 instead.</p>\\n<p>The purpose of the committee is presumably to ensure that the company doesn’t waste money. And yet the result is that the company pays 10 times as much.</p>\\n<p>…</p>\\n<p>In more recent times, Sarbanes-Oxley has practically destroyed the US IPO market [Ha! My accounting teachers never mentioned this]. That wasn’t the intention of the legislators who wrote it. They just wanted to add a few more checks on public companies. But they forgot to consider the cost. They forgot that companies about to go public are usually rather stretched, and that the weight of a few extra checks that might be easy for General Electric to bear are enough to prevent younger companies from being public at all.</p>\\n<p>…</p>\\n<p>Programmers are unlike many types of workers in that the best ones actually prefer to work hard. This doesn’t seem to be the case in most types of work. When I worked in fast food, we didn’t prefer the busy times. And when I used to mow lawns, I definitely didn’t prefer it when the grass was long after a week of rain.</p>\\n<p>Programmers, though, like it better when they write more code. Or more precisely, when they release more code. Programmers like to make a difference. Good ones, anyway.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Great stuff, <a href=\\\"http://www.paulgraham.com/artistsship.html\\\">read the whole thing</a>.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-11-30---process-embedded-reaction-prior-stupidity/index.md\n ** module id = 466\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Some words of wisdom\",\"tags\":null,\"date\":\"2008-12-01T00:34:44.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<blockquote>\\n<p>The slenderest knowledge that may be obtained of higher things is more desirable than the most certain knowledge that may be obtained of lesser things</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Thomas Aquinas</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-12-01---some-words-wisdom/index.md\n ** module id = 467\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Enterprise 2.0 Slides\",\"tags\":[\"enterprise2.0\"],\"date\":\"2008-12-11T16:41:56.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Presentation from one of my classes in Information Systems.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <iframe src=\\\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/838583\\\" width=\\\"427\\\" height=\\\"356\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" style=\\\"border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px 1px 0; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;\\\" allowfullscreen> </iframe>\\n</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2008-12-11---enterprise-20-slides/index.md\n ** module id = 468\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"In social media there's not one right answer\",\"tags\":[\"enterprise2.0\",\"social software\",\"social media\"],\"date\":\"2008-12-13T18:31:53.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Great blog post that explores the advantages and disadvantages of different social media structures.</p>\\n<p>He explores when you want to follow ideas (when the community is small) or people (when the community is too big to follow everything).</p>\\n<p>He discusses the search/browse debate and concludes you need both.

The birthday party is a social object.</p>\\n<p>Sue holds a tea party every Sunday evening. She invites all her friends and they come as they can. The tea party is a social object.</p>\\n<h3>Social objects bind us together.</h3>\\n<p>The more important a social object is to us, the stronger it’ll bind us to others who also hold that social object. I love <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org\\\">Drupal</a> and spend a good part of my time using it to build <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu\\\">cool websites</a>. As I meet others who also loves Drupal, we immediately have a strong connection through that shared social object.</p>\\n<p>When you meet someone new or go on a first date, you start asking questions hoping to find “something in common” or shared social objects.</p>\\n<p>If you date someone for a few months then break up, the reason you’ll often give is, “we just didn’t have much in common.”</p>\\n<p>Families develop traditions. My family eats fancy sandwiches each Christmas Eve. The shared memories and rituals we’ve developed bind us together. Traditions are social objects.</p>\\n<h3>Social objects come in all sorts of types and strength</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2007/08/what-makes-a-go.html\\\">Good social objects</a> are complex and have lots of hooks around which to start conversations. A football game has history, statistics, personalities, rivalries, and a plot with heroes, goats, and momentum shifts. All of which provide rich meat for discussion before, during and after the game.</p>\\n<h3>We change our behavior because of social objects</h3>\\n<p>If your coworkers are NBA fans and there’s a big game one night, you’ll watch the game so you can talk about it with your coworkers the next day. You buy that silly new iPhone app so you can share it with your coworkers. You join Facebook because all your friends are there. The NBA game, your new iPhone app, and Facebook are all social objects.</p>\\n<p>But it’s important to remember that it’s not the social objects that matter but people. Loving and being loved is what matters. Social objects are just the tool we use to make it happen.</p>\\n<p>Next I’ll write about <a href=\\\"/how-design-social-networking-site-using-social-objects\\\">how social object theory can help us build better social networking websites</a>.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2009-02-22---what-are-social-objects/index.md\n ** module id = 470\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"How to design a social networking site using social objects\",\"tags\":[\"social software\",\"drupal planet\",\"social objects\",\"social networking\"],\"date\":\"2009-02-27T18:20:59.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"readNext\":\"/what-are-social-objects/\",\"body\":\"<p>This is the second in a series of articles I’m writing to help me prep for my <a href=\\\"http://dc2009.drupalcon.org/session/building-advanced-social-networks-large-us-university\\\">session next week at Drupalcon</a>. The first article was my attempt to <a href=\\\"/what-are-social-objects\\\">define social objects</a>. This article outlines how to use social object theory to design better social networking sites.</p>\\n<p>First a review of <a href=\\\"http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/004390.html\\\">what are social objects</a>. “The Social Object is the reason two people are talking to each other, as opposed to talking to somebody else.” People are social creatures. Social objects are the tools we use to create opportunities to socialize with other people. And lastly, for all their importance, objects are just a means to an end – the end is loving and being loved.</p>\\n<p>So social objects are a cool theory but how can they help me design my new social networking site (or fix my broken one)?</p>\\n<p>Jyri Engestrom, founder of <a href=\\\"http://jaiku.com/\\\">Jaiku</a>, answered this question in his blog post, “<a href=\\\"http://www.zengestrom.com/blog/2005/04/why_some_social.html\\\">Why some social network services work and others don’t — Or: the case for object-centered sociality.</a>”</p>\\n<p>He argues:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>the term ‘social networking’ makes little sense if we leave out the objects that mediate the ties between people. Think about the object as the reason why people affiliate with each specific other and not just anyone. For instance, if the object is a job, it will connect me to one set of people whereas a date will link me to a radically different group. This is common sense but unfortunately it’s not included in the image of the network diagram that most people imagine when they hear the term ‘social network.’ The fallacy is to think that social networks are just made up of people. They’re not; social networks consist of people who are connected by a shared object.</p>\\n<p>The social networking services that really work are the ones that are built around objects. And, in my experience, their developers intuitively ‘get’ the object-centered sociality way of thinking about social life. Flickr, for example, has turned photos into objects of sociality. On <a href=\\\"http://del.icio.us\\\">del.icio.us</a> the objects are the URLs. EVDB, <a href=\\\"http://Upcoming.org\\\">Upcoming.org</a>, and evnt focus on events as objects.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Jyri wrote further that networking sites not based on social objects tend to not work as they are built on a flawed model for human interaction.</p>\\n<p>The steps then for designing your social networking site around social objects are first, pick the objects around which people will socialize, next, decide what users can do to the objects and finally, design how people can share the objects or other wise socialize around the objects. Or as <a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/chrismessina/statuses/1053693513\\\">Chris Messina</a> put it, “define the objects, name the verbs, network the objects”</p>\\n<p>Let’s look at some popular social networking sites and see how they’ve built their sites around social objects.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://flickr.com\\\">Flickr’s</a> social objects are pictures. People can do the following to pictures (the verbs): comment, annotate, tag, add them to sets and to groups, and share pictures through their URL.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://youtube.com\\\">YouTube’s</a> social objects are videos. People can watch, comment, rank, favorite, flag, create playlists of, and share objects.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://dogster.com\\\">Dogster’s</a> social objects are dogs (obviously). People can create profiles (for their dogs), give gifts, adopt other dogs, post videos and pictures, and find dog related businesses near their homes.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://drupal.org\\\">Drupal’s</a> social objects are Drupal (the software), the various modules in contrib and core, documentation pages, individual issues, and the various larger subtopics within the community such as documentation, social networking, education, and every other group found at <a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org\\\">groups.drupal.org</a> (each group is a social object).</p>\\n<p>Around issues in core and contrib, Drupalers can write issues, discuss issues on Twitter, IRC, email, blogs, enlist help on the issues through the same channels, and finally write code to solve issues.</p>\\n<p>Drupal, the social object, brings people to Drupalcon and various other meetups around the world. Drupal draws us to read Drupal planet and comment on people’s blogs. Drupal draws us to <a href=\\\"http://groups.drupal.org/node/19480\\\">comment and support other developers</a> building sites with Drupal.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://horncologne.com/content/community_our_strength_drupal_epiphany\\\">As</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.matthewbull.net/2008/10/23/hooked-into-drupal/\\\">is</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.angrydonuts.com/i-was-voted-packt-publishing-drupal-most-valuable-player\\\">often</a> <a href=\\\"http://cmscritic.com/drupal-founder-dries-buytaert-interview\\\">mentioned</a>, the strength of Drupal is not the code but the community. The ideals and goals of Drupal (the idea not software) is what draws more and more people to the Drupal community. And as positive interaction builds upon positive interaction, the social object Drupal becomes more and more powerful.</p>\\n<p>Jyri commented upon this in <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiWjAVcWK4g\\\">a keynote he delivered last year</a>. There he showed a picture he’d taken of himself and his boy in a forest. He said this picture had value but when he placed the picture on Flickr and his friends commented on it the picture became much more valuable.</p>\\n<p>The picture had intrinsic value as an ‘object’ but became much more valuable when it became a ‘social object’. The comments by Jyri’s friends turned his picture into a social object. Or as <a href=\\\"http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/004318.html\\\">Hugh likes to put it</a>, “social gestures beget social objects.” And as social gestures accumulate, the more valuable the social object becomes.</p>\\n<p>JP Rangaswami created, what I think, is a <a href=\\\"http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2008/02/16/musing-about-social-objects-molluscs-that-matter/\\\">brilliant metaphor for understanding how social objects grow through conversations</a>. He compared the growth in value of a social object to the gradual adding of new layers to a pearl by an oyster.</p>\\n<p>He wrote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Conversations grow around social objects, much like pearls grow around microscopic dust. Social objects are about growth, they are “live”.</p>\\n<p>A successful social object is one that has layer upon layer of conversation created around it; as the number of participants increases, social objects enjoy network effects.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So to sum things up. To create a thriving social networking site, first choose good social objects for the core of your site and then create ways for people to share the social objects and socialize around them.</p>\\n<p>My next post will be on social learning or how social object theory can help us design websites which help people with similar interests connect to each other and learn together.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2009-02-27---how-design-social-networking-site-using-social-objects/index.md\n ** module id = 471\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Ignite Salt Lake 2 Presentation\",\"tags\":[\"ignite\",\"ignite salt lake\",\"presentation\"],\"date\":\"2009-03-27T18:07:51.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I had a great time speaking last night at <a href=\\\"http://www.ignitesaltlake.com/ignite/index.cfm\\\">Ignite Salt Lake 2</a> on what we’re doing down at BYU with social networking in the classroom.

And talk about intimidation. I had a mild to strong case at different times of <a href=\\\"http://www.darcynorman.net/2009/08/20/on-the-open-education-experience/#comment-195623\\\">Chris Lott’s imposter syndrome</a>. So many brilliant thinkers. But I’m definitely glad I made the effort to go as I learned a great deal. Many of my assumptions were confirmed and many gaps in my understanding were exposed. So an excellent time of growth and learning.</p>\\n<p>The following is a few of the thoughts I had during the conference.</p>\\n<p>I loved the case studies some teachers presented about successes they’ve had in integrating social media tools into their classroom. These are brilliant teachers, visionary, willing to go the extra mile for their students, technologically adept – and really are showing the way to the future for the rest of us. But my concern is that as ed tech designers and creators that we’ll be misled by these examples.</p>\\n<p>These teachers are like a great pottery creator who makes brilliant one-off pieces of pottery art. Beautiful and inspiring but utterly useless at providing plates and bowls for the masses. Great teachers don’t scale. Their methods are incomprehensible and unusable by the average (or below-average teacher) which most students suffer with through their college experience.</p>\\n<p>A few quick cherry-picked (probably inaccurate) quotes from memory. <a href=\\\"http://openedconference.org/archives/549\\\">John Maxwell gave a session describing how he uses Wikis</a> to support Simon Fraser University Masters program in Publishing. He said he loved using wikis because the interface is just text. He could just edit different parts of the interface to quickly change it’s functionality. He described the technology, a plone-based wiki, as one of the less common wiki platforms but as being very powerful and versatile. I understood everything he said – but that’s because I’ve spent a considerable amount of time designing, using, and reading about wikis. But to your average professor, all of that would of been complete nonsense. Wikis? Textual interfaces? Plone? Another example, in David Wiley’s classes, students write blog posts and he collects these blog posts by using Google Reader – again, brilliant solution but how many teachers have a clue what a blog reader is, or for that matter, what a blog is. I love what these teachers are doing but the current method of using a grab-bag of free web2.0 social media tools to drive classroom learning is completely unusable for the vast majority of teachers and students.</p>\\n<p>The best teachers don’t realize how poor of teachers some of their colleagues are. Only students like me who have to sit through their classes can fully appreciate how wide the chasm is that separates the visionary resourceful teachers from the norm.</p>\\n<p>What we need to do is to study these visionary teachers, <a href=\\\"/presentation-opened-2009\\\">identify the successful patterns they’re using, and design social learning technology which implements these patterns</a> in a vastly simplified and consistent manner. Only then will these technologies and methods see large adoption across many universities around the world.</p>\\n<p>The first few days at the conference I was somewhat worried – perhaps as a consequence of my imposter syndrome. I started wandering if someone, somewhere had already figured everything out. I thought, surely with all this intellectual lightening crackling around me every problems been solved by now – which troubled me as I’m starting a company to develop a social learning platform – a worthless business if the works already been done.</p>\\n<p>But gradually, as the days went by, it dawned on me–everyone is as clueless as me! They’re has been brilliant insights made and illuminating experiments run – but things are still early. We’re still flailing around trying to figure things out. Which is good, I like to flail about experimenting with new ideas. That’s why I’m starting a new company in my apartment instead of sitting in a cubicle right now.</p>\\n<p>It was really interesting to me how differently I approach problems from the vast majority of people there at OpenEd. I’m at heart an engineer and by training a business person. I like to understand problems then solve them – preferably by building something cool. So it was remarkable for me to listen to conversations and sessions at OpenEd given by people almost entirely from a humanities / educational background. They framed and dissected problems in entirely different ways than me. I thought to myself after some of the sessions that what the presenter spent 45 minutes discussing, if that material had been part of a presentation I delivered, I might of spent all of one slide and thirty seconds discussing the same subject. But all the same, the new perspectives I heard are very valuable and a very useful addition to my mental toolkit for attacking problems.</p>\\n<p>Thanks again to all the organizers and participants who made the trip and time so worthwhile. I think it was a brilliant success for everyone involved.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2009-08-25---reflections-opened09/index.md\n ** module id = 477\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Deploying Social Software in Universities: Go Broad then Deep\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"elearning2.0\",\"enterprise2.0\",\"Learning\",\"social software\",\"social learning\"],\"date\":\"2009-09-02T23:53:44.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Michael Idinopolus wrote an intriguing post over on <a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/\\\">his excellent blog</a> yesterday titled “<a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/08/enterprise-20-skip-the-pilot.html\\\">Enterprise 2.0: Skip the Pilot.</a>”</p>\\n<p>I thought I’d repeat some of his arguments because it agrees nicely with an argument I’ve been formulating lately regarding deployment strategy for social learning software within higher education.</p>\\n<p>But first to his article:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>There’s an orthodoxy in Enterprise 2.0 circles about how you’re supposed to run an implementation. The orthodoxy goes something like this: Start with small-scale pilots, define your business objectives, watch the pilots closely, evaluate their success, make a go/no-go decision.</p>\\n<p>As far as I can tell it’s what everyone thinks. In fact, it’s what I used to think. Unfortunately, it’s dead wrong. The orthodoxy is wrong for a very simple reason: Size matters. By constraining the size of your pilot, you significantly alter the way your company can and will use the tools.</p>\\n<p>I’m not opposed to pilots for most enterprise IT solutions. Companies like to pilot new technologies with small populations before they roll them out enterprise-wide. That approach makes a lot of sense for transactional systems like order management, project management, purchasing, ERP, and so on. By piloting with a small group, you reduce implementation risk. You get a read on the value of the solution, and you get feedback which you can use to make modifications while those modifications are still relatively easy and inexpensive.</p>\\n<p>But social software is different from traditional IT. Traditional IT enables individuals to carry out well-defined, highly standardized transactions. Users go into the system to process transactions–to transfer funds, purchase supplies, track inventory, etc. The nature of these transactions, and the system’s ability to enable them, do not vary much according to the number of people using the system. Whether 100 people are entering orders or 10,000 people are entering orders, the transactions themselves doesn’t really change. What that means is that a representative small-scale sample is an accurate predictor of adoption and value at full scale.</p>\\n<p>But Enterprise 2.0 tools are different from traditional IT systems. Traditional IT enables <strong>transactions</strong>; Enterprise 2.0 enables <strong>interactions</strong>.</p>\\n<p>…</p>\\n<p>That doesn’t mean small-scale Enterprise 2.0 pilots can’t succeed. They can, and many do. But even when pilots succeed, they have limited ability to predict how the organization goes on to use the capabilities once they are rolled out enterprise-wide. Pilots typically fall into the lower left-hand corner of the <a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/04/the-social-software-value-matrix.html\\\">Social Software Value Matrix</a>: improve existing interactions within existing silos. That includes things like project team workspaces, departmental workspaces, and technical knowledgebases. When organizations really embrace Enterprise 2.0, however, they almost always play in multiple sections of the Value Matrix, launching solutions like collaborative intranets, ideation portals, private extranets, Those solutions, almost by definition, require scale.</p>\\n<p>Scale is the oxygen that feeds collaboration. That’s why collaborative tools like Facebook, and Twitter have taken off so spectacularly on the public web: With over a billion people on the Internet, the opportunities for interpersonal interaction are unbelievably high.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Ok, fair enough. Social software needs other people in order to work properly (imagine Facebook if it was just you there). What does that have to do with deploying a social learning platform at a university?</p>\\n<p>Before I answer that question, let me step back and explain a bit about what I mean by a social learning platform.</p>\\n<p>First it’s designed to support social learning meaning it’s designed to help/encourage/faciliate conversations and connections between like-minded learners as they pursue their personal learning goals.</p>\\n<p>Second it’s a platform giving the software two qualities:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>It gives people the freedom and tools to build onto the platform – in the case of a social learning platform, people will primarily build learning communities.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://andrewmcafee.org/2006/05/the_mechanisms_of_online_emergence/\\\">New patterns or structure will emerge within the system</a> that are unplanned and undirected</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>The social learning platform should improve existing interactions and create new interactions within classrooms, within majors, and between multiple institutions such as nearby universities or members of the community (or in other words, create value in each of the quadrants within the <a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/04/the-social-software-value-matrix.html\\\">social software value matrix</a>).</p>\\n<p>My best stab at creating this tool can be seen at <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu\\\">https://island.byu.edu</a>–a tool I’ve been building for some time with the help of many others. Island provides simple tools to improve existing interactions and enable new interactions within classrooms, across campus, and eventually will have tools that will allow learners from multiple campuses interact.</p>\\n<p>So how should such a tool be deployed at a university?</p>\\n<p>Michael Idinopolus answers that question in a second article “<a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/09/launching-at-scale-.html\\\">Launch E2.0 Broad, Then Go Deep</a>” where he references <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2006/04/power_law_of_pa.html\\\">Ross Mayfield’s power law of participation graph</a>.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/09/launching-at-scale-.html\\\"><img src=\\\"./power-law-participation.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>The key insight contained in the graph is that for different ways of participating in a social software environment there are different thresholds for joining. Reading takes little skill and effort while editing a wiki takes comparatively considerable more effort and community knowledge.</p>\\n<p>From this we’d also expect that the higher the threshold to participate in a certain way, the fewer people will participate. Survey results prove that out. While <a href=\\\"http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=879\\\">roughly 20-30% of Americans regularly read blogs</a>, only <a href=\\\"http://www.pewinternet.org/Commentary/2005/May/New-data-on-blogs-and-blogging.aspx\\\">6% of Americans have created a blog</a> (and probably considerably less regularly write updates).</p>\\n<p>I’ve seen the same sort of behavior on Island. I <a href=\\\"/power-law-graphs-from-classroom-community-website\\\">wrote a post on this subject last year</a> where I noticed a power law that emerged when I graphed the students participation in a number of different ways. I only posted two graphs in that post but the same relationship showed up across all types of participation. A few participated a great deal but most didn’t.</p>\\n<p>Returning to Michael’s article:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Historically, Enterprise 2.0 implementations have focused on collaborative tools [with] fairly high participation thresholds: blogs and wikis. That’s not by design, it’s by default. Until recently, those were the only Enterprise 2.0 tools that showed potential for high-value business use.</p>\\n<p>Today, Enterprise 2.0 participation is a whole different game. At the “low threshold” end of the curve, we have low-engagement tools like social messaging (internal “Twitter”), social bookmarking. By leading your implementation with these low-threshold tools, you lower the risk of implementation while still launching at the scale required for success.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>He goes on to describe an enthusiastic response to a recent webinar on his companies internal “twitter” app <a href=\\\"http://www.socialtext.com/products/signals.php\\\">Signals</a>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Signals was not just a useful tool, it was also a stepping stone that helped participants move to the right on the Participation curve (see image above). As participants started to get the hang of Signals, many started to ask about Socialtext’s other collaborative features: What are workspaces? How do I use the Dashboard? How do I look up an individual?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>From what I’ve seen, most social software deployments in universities have preceded in a similar way to what Michael describes – deploy high-value learning tools such as blogs and wikis in a small-pilot, evaluate their success, and make a go/no-go decision.</p>\\n<p>I think this is wrong for the same reasons Michael lists. First, a social learning platform needs large numbers of learners to work (“Scale is the oxygen that feeds collaboration”) and second, blogs and wikis are difficult tools to use – both the steepness of learning curve and the amount of time required to use them effectively. Relatively few students will ever use them to the extent that some of us wish.</p>\\n<p>In addition, I think we (grizzled web-heads who readily see the value of social software tools such as wikis and blogs in the classroom) frequently underestimate how scary and confusing these tools are to most teachers. These higher-threshold tools – they don’t get in general and definitely don’t get in specific, that is, how to use them in their classroom.</p>\\n<p>With Island we’ve focused on the bottom of the participation curve – enabling simple group-based conversations through email. For the past year we’ve been building and testing Island’s infrastructure within the Information Systems major. We’re now focused on achieving scale by inviting the rest of the BYU campus. Once we’ve achieved scale, we’ll (to quote Michael again) “deliver deep value by following up with local champions [deans, teachers, students] who want to invest time and effort in more robust, group-specific forms of collaboration.”</p>\\n<p>This, I think, is the correct sequence. Launch simply and broadly. Let students and teachers adjust to having a web-enabled learning environment. Then go deep by building into the social learning platform higher-value tools such as blogs, wikis, and other collaborative learning tools and workflows.</p>\\n<p>Your thoughts?</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2009-09-02---deploying-social-software-universities-broad-then-deep/index.md\n ** module id = 478\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"When in Doubt, Make it Public\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"social learning\"],\"date\":\"2009-09-10T00:15:20.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I recently (re)read a <a href=\\\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000840.html\\\">great post on Coding Horror</a> which pointed me towards an article by <a href=\\\"http://www.kottke.org/07/03/public-and-permanent/\\\">Jason Kottke who noted that many successful web2.0 projects</a> are a result of taking “something that everyone does with their friends and make it public and permanent.

It’s an ambitious project that’s leveraging quite a few different modules from the Drupalsphere.</p>\\n<p>Some of the features include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Import ical feeds.</li>\\n<li>Filter events for display by event category</li>\\n<li>Download customized ical feeds by category (i.e. Student wants to import just sport and academic events into his personal calendar).</li>\\n<li>Hovering on event titles exposes tooltip (we’re using <a href=\\\"http://www.lullabot.com/files/bt/bt-latest/DEMO/index.html\\\">Beautytips</a>) with full event info</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Here’s a screenshot of the UI as of last night:</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./tooltip.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>I wanted to blog about how we created our ical exports by category as I couldn’t find any documentation about this and it doesn’t work out of the box.</p>\\n<p>The default view from Calendar includes an ical display. This, by default, filters ical feeds by date – e.g. only include events in the ical feed after a certain date. This works fine.</p>\\n<p>The problem we ran into is how to filter the ical feed by taxonomy terms. In Views we created a taxonomy term filter and exposed that to users so they can created custom calendar views of different event categories. That worked wonderfully. The problem was that when you downloaded the ical feed from the filtered calendar view, it included all events, not just events from the categories you’d selected.</p>\\n<p>After examining the url for the ical feed we found the problem.</p>\\n<p>The default ical URL that’s generated looks like this:</p>\\n<p><code>/aiocalendar/calendar/ical/2009-10?tid[2]=2&amp;tid[1]=1&amp;tid[3]=3&amp;tid[4]=4&amp;tid[5]=5&amp;tid[6]=6&amp;tid[7]=7</code></p>\\n<p>Views takes each url segment separated by a forward slash as arguments. <code>calendar/ical</code> tells views to return an ical representation of the calendar. <code>2009-10</code> tells views to only include events from October 2009 onward. But the next bit, <code>?tid[2][2]=2&amp;tid[1][1]=1&amp;tid[3][3]=3&amp;tid[4][4]=4&amp;tid[5]=5&amp;tid[6][5]=6&amp;tid[7][6]=7</code>, a list of term IDs that were currently active on the calendar view, weren’t working at helping Views produced a filtered ical feed.</p>\\n<p>Digging into the taxonomy term argument, I discovered it expected arguments in the form of <code>1+2+3</code> or <code>1,2,3</code>. <code>1+2+3</code> meaning Views would return events that had terms <code>1 OR 2 OR 3</code> and <code>1,2,3</code> meaning Views would return events that had terms <code>1 AND 2 AND 3</code>. For example, <code>aiocalendar/calendar/ical/2009-10/1+4+6</code> would return an ical feed of all events from October 2009 onward that had term ids of <code>1 or 4 or 6</code>.</p>\\n<p>I jumped to the command line and tested my theory by using wget and some handcrafted urls and it worked! The ical feeds I was getting only included events from categories I included as arguments in the URL.</p>\\n<p>Now the trick was to override the ical url generated to replace it with one in the correct format. I found the theme function in the Calendar module where the the ical feed icon was generated, copied that to my module, and rewrote the url using some regex kungfu (read more <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/node/11811\\\">on overriding theme functions</a> in the <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/handbooks\\\">Drupal handbook</a>).</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-php\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">&lt;?php</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">/*\\n * Override theme_calendar_ical_icon() so we can override the url produced.\\n */</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">phptemplate_calendar_ical_icon</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">($url)</span> </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Pull out array of Term IDs from the url.</span>\\n  $search = preg_match_all(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"/tid\\\\[([0-9])*\\\\]/\\\"</span>, $url, $matches);\\n  $tids = $matches[<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>];\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Grab url stem, we'll add the Term ID arguments back in a bit.</span>\\n  $search = preg_match(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"/(.*ical\\\\/)20[0-9]{2}-.*/\\\"</span>, $url, $url_stem);\\n\\n  $url = $url_stem[<span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">1</span>];\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Views arguments treat a \\\"+\\\" between arguments as OR.</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// So we're crafting an argument that asks for all events which match one of the</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// term IDs.</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">foreach</span>($tids <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">as</span> $tid) {\\n    $url .= $tid . <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"+\\\"</span>;\\n  }\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Trim off extra +</span>\\n  $url = trim($url, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"+\\\"</span>);\\n\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> ($image = theme(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'image'</span>, drupal_get_path(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'module'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'date_api'</span>) .<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'/images/ical16x16.gif'</span>, t(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Add to calendar'</span>), t(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Add to calendar'</span>))) {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&lt;div style=\\\"text-align:right\\\"&gt;&lt;a href=\\\"'</span>. check_url($url) .<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'\\\" class=\\\"ical-icon\\\" title=\\\"ical\\\"&gt;'</span>. $image .<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'</span>;\\n  }\\n}\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">?&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We’ll be releasing our calendar, custom code and all, as a feature on BYU’s own feature server once the new calendar is released to production.

With blogs, twitter, wikis, and other social media tools, our ability to share what we’re learning with others has increased dramatically. The shift from learning in private to learning in public is dramatic and chaotic, much like swimming from the edge of a river into the fast flowing current. All of a sudden you’re being pushed and tumbled along much faster than before.</p>\\n<p>I’m reading a book by Albert Bandura this semster called “Social Learning Theory.” Bandura was a psychologist in the mid to late 20th century who researched the role of <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Bandura\\\">social modeling on human motivation, thought, and action</a>. A lot of what I’m reading supports what I’ve experienced with learning in the open.</p>\\n<p>Here’s some of what he wrote on social modeling:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Learning would be exceedingly laborious, not to mention hazardous, if people had to rely solely on the effects of their own actions to inform them what to do. Fortunately, most human behavior is learned observationally through modeling: from observing others one forms an idea of how new behaviors are performed, and on later occasions this coded information serves as a guide for action. Because people can learn from example what to do, at least in approximate form, before performing any behavior, they are spared needless errors.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>One of the best parts about being an entrepreneur in this day and age is the many great learning resources on the internet. My favorite place to hangout on the internet is <a href=\\\"http://news.ycombinator.com/\\\">Hacker News</a>. There hackers (the good type) and entrepreneurs share interesting news and opinion posts and have conversations about them. Almost everything I know about entrepreneurship has come from joining and participating and emulating others within that community of makers who, to an incredible extent, learn in the open.</p>\\n<p>I started doing web development about three years ago – and at the time knew almost nothing really about building websites. But I made the decision then to join the Drupal community and learn web development using the Drupal social publishing platform. Since then I’ve learned an great deal about building sophisticated modern websites. I’ve been to two Drupal conferences and presented at both. I participated in the Google Summer of Code last year on a Drupal project. I’ve spent hundreds of hours reading blog posts from other Drupalers and hundreds more hours reading discussions between programmers about how to write different pieces of code studying how they think and solve technical problems. Almost everything I know about web development has come from my choice to involve myself in the Drupal community.</p>\\n<p>The problem with many classes in the University and K-12 is that teachers (and students) forget that learning is much more than the acquisition of facts and figures – learning is the process of becoming something. It’s the the process of becoming a full member of a <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice\\\">community of practice.</a></p>\\n<p>To become a physicist one for sure must learn physics equations. But much more than that, the student must learn to <em>be</em> a physicist – think and act like a physicist would. Approach problems like a physicist would.</p>\\n<p>If teachers ask students to learn in the open – through blogging, editing wikis, public discussions, etc – the more advanced students will serve as models for the rest and the student’s progress at learning to become a chemist, a mathematician, a programmer, or whatever the community may be that they are trying to enter, will accelerate. The progress is even greater if teachers actively model the thinking and problem-solving skills of that community.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.connectivism.ca/?p=122\\\">George Siemen’s explained the idea very well</a> when he wrote, “Watching others learn is an act of learning.”</p>\\n<p>He continued:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Let me explain. When someone decides to share their thoughts and ideas in a transparent manner, they become a teacher to those who are observing. Social technology – such as Twitter, blogs, Facebook – opens the door to sharing the process of learning, not only the final product.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>There’s a lot of promising educational ideas out there – but this one excites me probably the most of all of them. Why? because it’s so simple to implement. The teachers and students just have to do what they have been doing – but make it open. And then reap the benefits.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2009-10-07---learning-open/index.md\n ** module id = 483\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Organizing University Learning: Moving Beyond the Course to Micro-labs\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"Learning\",\"social networking\",\"social learning\",\"micro-labs\",\"universities\",\"courses\"],\"date\":\"2009-10-21T17:43:27.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>University learning is centered on the course.

But no rational person would suggest this is the only workable solution or even what’s best, or adequate, for all purposes.</p>\\n<p>There have been many alternative models proposed. One model I’ve taken a liking to was described in a recent journal article by Ann Pendleton-Jullian titled, <a href=\\\"http://fourplusone.wordpress.com/design-education-and-innovation-ecotones/\\\">Design Education and Innovation Ecotones</a>.</p>\\n<p>Over the next couple of weeks I’ll be recycling material from a paper that <a href=\\\"http://www.timolsen.com/\\\">Tim Olsen</a> and I wrote this past summer (which was rejected for publication sadly – but luckily we have our own worldwide publication systems we can use as a fall-back :) on the micro-labs concept and our experience running and participating in class that used similar concepts.</p>\\n<h2>Micro Labs</h2>\\n<p>Micro-labs are small learning communities centered around answering a question, not mastering standardized content/skills</p>\\n<p>Micro-labs are a proposed university course architecture which supports and incorporates “web 2.0” informal learning principles, enabling students to entirely create their own curriculum with the goal of contributing all objects created by learning back to a learning community of practice, and an Internet audience. This course design seeks to harness both the student’s natural (intrinsic) desire to learn and the ease of access to knowledge created by advances in communication technologies.</p>\\n<p>Micro-labs may be contrasted with a normal lab, which are found at most universities. Labs are large expensive operations that might take years to set-up and are expected to run for many years. Micro-labs, by contrast, are quick to set-up and cheap to run with as few as 2-3 students and a faculty adviser who meet in the Library. Many small, tightly networked micro-labs would collectively create an impact far beyond a few larger labs.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>[these micro-labs are] easier and quicker than large centers to plan, build and reconfigure as projects shift and move in other directions, they facilitate grassroots creative research. These highly networked micro labs, focused on topics of deep inquiry, need not have dozens of participants sitting in the same room. A team of participants with the necessary skills might be distributed among several institutions, several countries, networked digitally and through ongoing academic relationships…Because they are networked, a single micro-lab’s reach extends beyond the team itself or the duration of a specific project. When the opportunity arises, these micro-labs can coalesce into one larger lab with tremendous diversity and richness of talent. Breaking apart again, they may redistribute talent and resources. Analogous to the way ‘process networks’ mobilize highly specialized small companies across an extended integrated design and manufacturing process, a network of micro-labs creates a horizontal rhizomic structure in which the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts. The networked micro-lab can adapt to new questions and opportunities from outside as well as inside the network. <em>(Pendleton-Jullian, 2009)</em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Micro-labs are a simple and efficient mechanism for providing students informal learning opportunities in niches of their choices.</p>\\n<p>In a micro-labs course, student teams outline a plan of study and learning deliverables with the help of an instructor. Each study is completed over the period of 2-6 weeks. Coached by an instructor, students utilize any content they wish, including Open Educational Resources, to learn material in an authentic learning environment (Herrington &amp; Oliver, 2000). The learning outcomes consist of deliverables, which are typically given to the community, including blog posts, tutorials, software tools, and conference presentations.</p>\\n<p>Micro-labs courses promise many benefits. In some universities 50 percent of enrollment is concentrated in only 25 of the largest classes (Graham &amp; Stacey, 2002). This suggests the high financial cost of serving students in smaller niche classes, which can be reduced through the use of micro-labs courses as one teacher can coach significantly more student-led learning teams and less building resources are needed. Self-adaptive learning benefits students as they are able to learn the material in the manner, and with the resources of their choice. Students are also able to learn from and contribute to a community of practice in which they may later be employed. In addition, micro-labs courses better prepare students for today’s highly competitive and rapidly changing workplace, as they develop experience in directing their own learning.</p>\\n<h3>Micro-labs as a Class</h3>\\n<p>A normal class defines both the required learning outcomes and the required inputs (the homework, projects, group assignments etc.) that students must experience in order to (hopefully) arrive at the required outcomes. In other words, the professor decides, not only <em>what</em> the students should learn but also <em>how</em> they should learn.</p>\\n<p>This factory model for education is growing increasingly untenable as the world grows more complex. Today’s students graduate into a world of far greater uncertainty and far greater diversity as the formerly monolithic landscape dominated by a few large companies grows increasing fragmented and diversified. Our universities must help prepare students for many more types of career paths.</p>\\n<p>The core idea is that micro-lab classes adapts to its learners instead of requiring its learners to adapt to the class. This is the central idea of many web 2.0 applications. Services such as Twitter and Flickr provide simple mechanisms that users can apply to meet a large number of needs. In a similar way, the micro-lab course provides an architecture for students to build learning communities and use learning objects of their choosing.</p>\\n<p>Another model that’s helpful in understanding micro-lab classes is supply-push vs. demand-pull. Supply-push describes the traditional curriculum model, where faculty plan their courses to push knowledge to students through means such as textbooks or lectures. Demand-pull describes the type of learning typically done by extracurricular learners. For example, a person desiring more knowledge (demand) about RFID tags might search the Internet and pull information from various web pages.</p>\\n<p>A micro-lab class is a demand-pull not supply-push type class. Students decide what they want to learn and pull in content as needed and ask questions to different learning communities as needed. Supply-push models work best when resources are scarce, such as when professors are the sole source of information. Demand-pull models seem best when resources are abundant. Today’s Internet provides a tidal wave of information that learners can access.</p>\\n<p>Brown and Adler state:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The demand-pull approach is based on providing students with access to rich (sometimes virtual) learning communities built around a practice. It is passion-based learning, motivated by the student either wanting to become a member of a particular community of practice or just wanting to learn about, make, or perform something. Often the learning that transpires is informal rather than formally conducted in a structured setting. Learning occurs in part through a form of reflective practicum, but in this case the reflection comes from being embedded in a community of practice that may be supported by both a physical and a virtual presence and by collaboration between newcomers and professional practitioners/scholars.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In my next post, I’ll describe a micro-lab class we ran at BYU.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2009-10-21---organizing-university-learning-moving-beyond-classroom/index.md\n ** module id = 484\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"How we ran a micro-lab course\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"social learning\",\"micro-labs\",\"connectivism\"],\"date\":\"2009-10-30T16:26:04.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>This is the second part of a (most likely) three-part series of posts I’m harvesting from a journal article Tim Olsen and I wrote earlier this year. You might want to read the first post for context, <a href=\\\"/organizing-university-learning-moving-beyond-classroom\\\">Organizing University Learning: Moving Beyond the Course to Micro-labs</a>, before continuing here.</p>\\n<p>This post is taken from the section of the paper where we describe our experience running a micro-lab course (with <a href=\\\"http://warp.byu.edu/site/\\\">Conan Albrecht</a> as the head teacher) in the <a href=\\\"http://marriottschool.byu.edu/bsisys/\\\">Information Systems department</a> at <a href=\\\"http://byu.edu\\\">BYU</a>.</p>\\n<p>First a review of the micro labs concept taken from the <a href=\\\"/organizing-university-learning-moving-beyond-classroom\\\">first post</a>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Micro-labs are small learning communities centered around answering a question, not mastering standardized content/skills</p>\\n<p>Micro-labs are a proposed university course architecture which supports and incorporates “web 2.0” informal learning principles, enabling students to entirely create their own curriculum with the goal of contributing all objects created by learning back to a learning community of practice, and an Internet audience. This course design seeks to harness both the student’s natural (intrinsic) desire to learn and the ease of access to knowledge created by advances in communication technologies.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>In our micro-lab course, the students were asked to do four projects through the course of the semester. Each project had four steps. Students 1) create and post on the class website a learning contract specifying what they wish to learn, their process for learning, and planned deliverables. This contract is 2) revised with feedback from the instructor and fellow students. Students 3) complete the proposed learning contract and 4) share the completed deliverables by posting them to the class website and delivering an ignite-style presentation to the class (and if you’re curious, all learning contracts, project deliverables, and public discussion can be see on the <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/unclass/content/winter-2009-projects\\\">class website</a>).</p>\\n<h2>1. Formation of Learning Contract</h2>\\n<p>The project proposals were written by a student or a group of students, and defines what they wish to learn during the 3-4 week period of each project. Proposals can be a “learning project”, where students research a topic and write up a report, or a “building project”, where the student defines what they will create. Examples of learning projects include a <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/unclass/wiki/jee5-learning-write\\\">report on Java Enterprise Edition 5</a>, or <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/cloud-computing/wiki/amazon-web-services-overview\\\">wiki pages describing Amazon web services.</a> Building projects include making an <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/unclass/content/android-web-service-app-my-weather-running-and-full-source-code\\\">Android application</a>, a <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/unclass/wiki/visual-lyrics-phase-2\\\">lyrics visualization plug-in for iTunes</a>, or an <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/unclass/wiki/text-messaging-sms-gateway-interactivity\\\">SMS gateway</a>. During the last week of each project, students start to prepare learning contracts for the next iteration.</p>\\n<p>An obvious feature of the learning contract is that it is written entirely by the student. This allows for intrinsic motivation, as is illustrated in this student quote: “I was able to learn a lot about and use a bunch of technologies that I never would have been able to otherwise. I feel like I learned more than in a normal class, and because I got to choose what I wanted to learn, I would usually have trouble putting down my unclass project work to take care of my other homework.”</p>\\n<p>The ambiguous nature of how much work should go into a contract was a source of frustration for students. One student describes the initial disorganization and lack of set expectation: “We didn’t have any initial standard to set our projects to. I wasn’t sure if I had to build something huge to be considered complete, and I wasn’t sure what was expected of the presentations. I chalk all of that up to a learning experience though. I wasn’t given a ceiling so I was inclined to take my projects as far as I could, primarily because they were fun.” This quote raises an interesting research question: If students (instead of teachers) are allowed to set a learning contract for a course, are the students more ambitious?</p>\\n<h2>2. Students Incorporate Feedback into Proposals.</h2>\\n<p>Students post their learning contract to the class website to elicit feedback from the instructor and other students. This enables other students to see and learn from the feedback from the instructor. It also allows for the possible recruitment of other students to participate in the learning project. Once the contract is revised, the instructor approves the project and the students’ grade is bound to the satisfactory completion of the project.</p>\\n<h2>3. Contract fulfillment</h2>\\n<p>Students work individually or in teams to complete their learning contracts. They are challenged with the task of finding their own learning resources, and may ask the instructor and other students for direction. This is seen as a key feature of the design. As students find their own learning resources they are able to select resources which they find most helpful. Research suggests that students and experts possess different cognitive structures (Ericsson, Charness, Feltovich, &amp; Robert R. Hoffman, 2006). Experts are able compare a new situation to what they have experienced before through pattern recognition and are then able to recognize nuances and focus on important, rather than unessential elements.</p>\\n<p>Novices do not yet have a rich experience base, and as such learning is sequential (R. R. Hoffman, Shadbolt, Burton, &amp; Klein, 1995). We suggest that as students possess similar cognitive architectures they are better able to relate to novices in their class and outside of their class. As the process of learning becomes “transparent” and open through the use of technology students are able to use resources created by other novices to grapple with new subjects.</p>\\n<h3>What resources did the students use?</h3>\\n<p>If, as we suggest, students are better able to learn from learning objects created by novices (instead of experts), allowing the students to incorporate and find their own learning objects is a logical design for a course. Yet, from our experience, doing this can be very difficult for teachers. Data from the students gave surprising results on what resources were used to complete projects, and how they were found.</p>\\n<p>We were surprised by how many students used social networks to find learning resources. One student remarked, “Usually I would just start on a project, and when I came to the parts I didn’t know as much about I would search using Google and talk to friends who I thought might be knowledgeable on the subject.” As the course progressed student’s utilized the social network created through the class blog and wiki which was used to share knowledge that students had developed through the course of completing projects. This is illustrated through the following student comment.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>It was very helpful to use island and the respective blogs resulting from other student’s completed projects as a resource for my projects. I could remember certain things that the other class members were doing from their projects and ask them questions via instant messaging or island [the course website]. Because the class members took ownership of their projects I found them all to be very knowledgeable about the subjects they studied. This helped build a very nice knowledge base.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Another student mentioned other professors and students as well as people he had met on the internet through blogs as means through which he found educational resources. Most students mentioned that they contributed to the class blog as well as other students blogs, or their own blogs.</p>\\n<h2>4. Share learning deliverable</h2>\\n<p>Student’s share what they learn in two ways. First they post it on the course website so that other students can read and comment on it. Second, they create an “ignite presentation” which consists of a 5 minute power point presentation of 20 slides in which the slides automatically advance every 15 seconds. This is intended to be a rapid way of transmitting ideas in an engaging and entertaining manner.</p>\\n<p>By making the student learning deliverables available publicly on the Internet, it encourages student accountability for learning and creates learning objects that classmates and future students can access and build upon for their learning projects. These public traces of work are also useful as mentioned because students, by seeing what other students are working on, learn which students are expert in what and are able to use them as learning resources for those subjects. Another advantage is it helps market the class, major, and university to current and potential students. As these future students come to explore the college or university they will be able to “lurk” and see the projects and potential colleagues which they would be working with.</p>\\n<h2>Assessment</h2>\\n<p>Given the unusual nature of the class, assessment was handled differently. The majority (70%) of the points came from completely the contract as agreed upon in the learning contract. The remainder of the points were awarded for either extra work done on projects or where students helped other students in some way. This following is <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu/unclass/wiki/unclasssyllabus\\\">the assessment portion of the class syllabus</a>:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>70% of your grade will come from the completion of your project. Items to be graded include:</li>\\n<li>Complete a contract that lists the work to be done (or learning to be achieved), the specific tasks or responsibilities of each student in the group, and any deliverables to be created.</li>\\n<li>Complete an appropriately difficult project meeting the contract agreed upon</li>\\n<li>Submit weekly progress updates</li>\\n<li>Attendance at weekly group meetings</li>\\n<li>Give an ignite presentation</li>\\n<li>Attend and present at least one session at the twice per semester unconference</li>\\n<li>20% of your grade will come from Learning 2.0 points. These include things such as:</li>\\n<li>Reviewing and making comments on other students’ contracts</li>\\n<li>Stories or blog posts to your project Island group</li>\\n<li>Comments made on other users’ stories, blog posts, and comments</li>\\n<li>Other indicators of interactions and work</li>\\n<li>10% of your grade will come from Friend points.</li>\\n<li>These are points that others can give to you (the student). They are totally at the discretion of the owner of the points. The teacher has a number of friend points he can assign, and each student has friend points he or she can give. Each student will be given 10 friends points per project. These points must be given to other students during the project or they are lost.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Two students mentioned that the grading procedure was the worst part of the class: “There was no fair assessment of the work we did.” “The [biggest problem with the course] was trying to figure out a grading metric for the class.”</p>\\n<p>As this was our first time involved with this type of course, we were unsure what would unfold. We were pleased to watch the class become a success, and see self-directed learning, and peer-teaching. Strong connections quickly formed between students which enabling them to access learning resources found throughout the community. We’re sure our course design could be significantly improved but we are thrilled it was successful as it was.</p>\\n<p>Ericsson, K. A., Charness, N., Feltovich, P. J., &amp; Hoffman, R. R. (2006).

It’s an incredibly dense read but so far my efforts have been richly rewarded.</p>\\n<p>I haven’t read enough of the book yet to feel up to writing a proper review/analysis but I wanted to pass along a bit from the introduction to the paperback edition that McLuhan wrote on education as the analysis (~50 years after it was written!) is still spot on and entirely appropriate to our discussions today on what education should become in the 21st century.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Any new technology gradually creates a totally new human environment. Environments are not passive wrappings but active processes. In his splendid work <em><a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Preface-Plato-History-Greek-Mind/dp/0674699068\\\">Preface to Plato</a></em> (Harvard University Press, 1963), Eric Havelock contrasts the oral and written cultures of the Greeks. By Plato’s time the written word had created a new environment that had begun to detribalize man. Previously the Greeks had grown up by benefit of the process of the tribal encyclopedia. They had memorized the poets. The poets provided specific operational wisdom for all the contingencies of life–Ann Landers in verse. With the advent of individualized man, a new education was needed. Plato devised such a new program for literate men. It was based on the Ideas. With the phonetic alphabet, classified wisdom took over from the operational wisdom of Homer and Hesiod and the tribal encyclopedia. Education by classified data has been the Western program ever since.</p>\\n<p>Now, however, in the electronic age, data classification yields to pattern recognition, the key phrase at IBM. When data move instantly, classification is too fragmentary. In order to cope with data a electric speed in typical situations of “information overload,” men resort to the study of configurations, like the sailor in <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Descent_into_the_Maelstr%C3%B6m\\\">Edgar Allan Poe’s <em>Maelstrom</em></a>. The drop-out situation in our schools at present has only begun to develop. The young student today grows up in an electrically configured world. It is a world not of wheels but of circuits, not of fragments but of integral patterns. The student today <em>lives</em> mythically and in depth. At school, however, he encounters a situation organized by means of classified information. The subjects are unrelated. They are visually conceived in terms of a blueprint. The student can find no possible means of involvement for himself, nor can he discover how the educational scene relates to the “mythic” world of electronically processed data and experience that he takes for granted. As one IBM executive puts it, “My children had lived several lifetimes compared to their grandparents when they begun grade one.”</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>His definition of “myth” is necessary to understand the above quote. Taken from pg. 25 of the paperback version:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Myth is the instant vision of a complex process that ordinarily extends over a long period. Myth is contraction or implosion of any process, and the instant speed of electricity confers the mythic dimension on ordinary industrial and social action today.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Later in the book McLuhan writes that, “We <em>live</em> mythically but continue to think fragmentarily and on single planes.” The new electronic/internet environment we live in has reshaped how we live, learn, and work. The disconnect McLuhan identified between how we live and learn <em>outside</em> of school vs. <em>inside</em> of school has only grown since the 1960s.</p>\\n<p>Much of what passes for educational best practices these days are merely vestiges of a bygone era. For better or for worse, the electronic age has radically reshaped human thought and behavior. Clinging to educational practices designed to teach “data classification” helps no one – especially the students who are facing a world radically different than the one our schools prepare them for.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2009-11-12---marshall-mcluhan-education/index.md\n ** module id = 486\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Three adoption patterns for educational social software\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"elearning2.0\",\"enterprise2.0\",\"Learning\",\"social software\",\"organizational behavior\",\"micro-labs\"],\"date\":\"2009-11-18T19:55:21.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>I’ve been reading and thinking a lot lately about how to drive more adoption of the social learning platform I’m building here at BYU, <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu\\\">https://island.byu.edu</a>, and wanted to summarize some of the highlights of what I’ve learned. All of the patterns come directly from <a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/\\\">Ross Mayfield</a> and <a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/\\\">Michael Idinopulos’s</a> writings so a big shout out to the great work they’re doing at <a href=\\\"http://www.socialtext.com/\\\">Socialtext</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Pattern 1: Launch Broad then Deep</h2>\\n<p>I wrote extensively about this pattern about a month ago in my post <a href=\\\"/deploying-social-software-universities-broad-then-deep\\\">Deploying Social Software in Universities: Go Broad then Deep</a>. The crux of the argument is that when deploying social software, you should first aim to get wide adoption, sign up as many people as possible, before trying to facilitate deeper, more complex engagement between your users. Social software without people is useless or as <a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/08/enterprise-20-skip-the-pilot.html\\\">Michael Idinopulos puts it</a>, “Scale is the oxygen that feeds collaboration.” In the competitive web2.0 world, the simplest tool almost always will win.</p>\\n<p>Once you’ve achieved broad adoption, the next step is to go deep. To quote Michael again, “[after achieving scale] deliver deep value by following up with local champions [deans, teachers, students] who want to invest time and effort in more robust, group-specific forms of collaboration.”</p>\\n<p>So launch simply and broadly. Let students and teachers adjust to having a web-enabled learning environment. Then go deep by building into the social learning platform higher-value tools such as blogs, wikis, and other collaborative learning tools and workflows.</p>\\n<h2>Pattern 2: Help Learners Climb the Participation Curve</h2>\\n<p>Ross Mayfield came up with a beautiful concept a number of years ago called the “<a href=\\\"http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2006/04/power_law_of_pa.html\\\">Power Law of Participation</a>”</p>\\n<p>Reproduced image:</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/09/launching-at-scale-.html\\\"><img src=\\\"./power-law-participation.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></a></p>\\n<p>The essence of the model is that in any community, the vast majority of the members will not have a very high level of engagement with the community. For example, in most classes there will be a few students who actively participate while the rest play solitaire. When you first deploy social learning software, most learners will only participate by reading. While they do get value from reading and lurking in communities, learners will benefit even more if they move up the participation curve and engage more deeply in some of the communities they participate in.</p>\\n<p>Software adoption can be thought of in two dimensions, broad and deep. If your learners are successfully engaging in higher value / engagement tasks on your site, this deep adoption is occurring.</p>\\n<h2>Pattern 3: Focus on Creating Value</h2>\\n<p>It’s far to easy to focus on the tools we use rather than the value we’re trying to create (See Jon Mott’s blog, “<a href=\\\"http://www.jonmott.com/blog/2008/06/beginning-with-the-end-in-mind/\\\">The End in Mind</a>” for an extended discussion on this subject). Adoption will increase if we focus on more creating value (<a href=\\\"http://www.globalnerdy.com/2009/10/17/its-about-helping-your-users-become-awesome-or-being-better-is-better-by-kathy-sierra/\\\">making our users awesome</a>) and less on the specific tools we are building/using.</p>\\n<p>A social learning platform can add value to educational institutions in four contexts (See Michael’s post <a href=\\\"http://michaeli.typepad.com/my_weblog/2009/04/the-social-software-value-matrix.html\\\">The Social Software Value Matrix</a> for more):</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Within the classroom</li>\\n<li>Within departments</li>\\n<li>Within the institution</li>\\n<li>Across multiple institutions</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Socialtext recently released a white paper on the <a href=\\\"http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:vxa4yzS7cNcJ:www.socialtext.com/documents/wp_6WaystoGetBusinessValuefromSocialSoftware.pdf+formal+informal+socialtext&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;sig=AFQjCNFjnMdK1kI1rm0w-XW6Vxx0WlzFYQ\\\">6 Ways to Get Business Value from Social Software</a>. They discuss there how social software can greatly improve the formal and informal processes in each of the contexts that social software operates in.</p>\\n<p>Formal processes they define as “those things your organization does on a repeated basis.”</p>\\n<p>In an educational environment those would be things such as lectures, quizzes, studying, group projects, writing essays, exams, and so forth.</p>\\n<p>Informal processes they define as “all the many interactions that take place outside of this [formal] structure. They are not predictable and repeated, and therefore cannot be codified and defined… Informal processes make up the bulk of [learners] interactions.”</p>\\n<p>In an educational environment informal processes would include such activities as informal study groups, conversations in hallways, individuals or small groups meeting with professors or TAs, forums, clubs, and so forth.</p>\\n<p>Within an educational institutions there are many formal and informal learning processes that can be improved. As we focus on identifying poor processes and creating learning tools that clearly improve them, adoption of our social learning software will increase.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2009-11-18---three-adoption-patterns-educational-social-software/index.md\n ** module id = 487\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"McLuhan predicts newspaper's demise in 1965.\",\"tags\":[\"newspapers\"],\"date\":\"2009-12-19T20:29:17.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Reading through “<a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Media-Extensions-Marshall-McLuhan/dp/0262631598\\\">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</a>” by Marshall McLuhan, I came across this gem of a quote:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>The classified ads (and stock-market quotations) are the bedrock of the press.

When first started teaching classrooms, thought about how to use online media to overcome disadvantages of teaching in classrooms namely a) not all teachers good at speaking extemporously and b) classroom learning militates against thoughtfulness, can’t share thought that occurs an hour after class.</p>\\n<p>First started experimenting with using online tools for learning in 1995.</p>\\n<p>When first started teaching in 2005? Used wikis from one tool, forums from another, blogs from another. Immediate feedback from students was this was too complex. So thought about consolidating tools. Entered Haystack competition and won some money to create the <a href=\\\"http://socialmediaclassroom.com\\\">socialmediaclassroom.com</a>.</p>\\n<p>Socialmediaclassroom tool is freely downloadable or you can ask for hosted version. He’s developed a number of lesson plans for introducing participatory media to students.</p>\\n<p>Developed way within Drupal to tie all work done around a lecture to be listed on page.</p>\\n<p>Says forums not used as much as 10-15 years ago.</p>\\n<p>Unique accordance of forums – long-lasting conversations on topics. Help students get to know each other. Continue classroom discussions asynchronously online.</p>\\n<p>Introducing other features of socialmediaclassroom – blogs w/ rich media, group chat, syllabus in the wiki, social bookmarking (which is new to a lot of students) – use to collect resources for class project. Depending on class, sends students to delicious or diigo for discovery of different resources.</p>\\n<p>Has found that moving classroom chairs into a circle resulting in increase in classroom conversation.</p>\\n<p>Has co-teaching teams made up of students. He asks them to lists concepts and terms talked about in each class. Then other classmates fill out the descriptions.</p>\\n<p>Surprised at how <em>illiterate</em> most students were when he started teaching college students.</p>\\n<p>Essence of what skills needs to teach children – How can you find the answer to any question? How do you know that what you find is accurate?</p>\\n<p>Example he uses – if do search for “martin luther king jr” The 8th result is from <a href=\\\"http://martinlutherking.org\\\">martinlutherking.org</a> – which is a website slamming on MLK. Used <a href=\\\"http://whoisit.com\\\">whoisit.com</a> to find <a href=\\\"http://martinlutherking.org\\\">martinlutherking.org</a> owned by white nationalist site Stormfront.</p>\\n<p>Seems clear that youth are moving from passive consumption to active participation. Youth can create as well as consume online.</p>\\n<p>Gave a number of examples of how students are using social tools to help organize collective action.</p>\\n<p>We need to look at network theory, sociology research, network literacies, media theory as we redesign education for the digital age.</p>\\n<p>Don’t just pay attention to technology, also pay attention to literacies.</p>\\n<p>Social medias are not always appropriate to teaching</p>\\n<p>Not add ons, essential elements of student’s lives of today and tomorrow.

Head over to <a href=\\\"http://eduglu.com\\\">eduglu.com</a> and leave your email address to hear when we open up for business and to provide early feedback.</p>\\n<p>This will be our initial stab at creating a <a href=\\\"http://buytaert.net/on-business-models-for-drupal-distributions\\\">sustainable business model for our Drupal educational distribution</a>. There’s been <a href=\\\"http://acquia.com/blog/drupal-software-publishing\\\">a</a> <a href=\\\"http://buytaert.net/on-business-models-for-drupal-distributions\\\">lot</a> <a href=\\\"http://developmentseed.org/blog/2010/mar/13/ideas-open-atrium-partners-program\\\">of</a> discussion <a href=\\\"http://www.agileapproach.com/blog-entry/openpublish-20-and-beyond-labor-love-1\\\">lately</a> in the Drupal community about finding business models that can help create sustainable Drupal Distributions. I’m not sure hosted Eduglu is the right business model for that task but since a startup is “<a href=\\\"http://steveblank.com/2010/04/12/why-startups-are-agile-and-opportunistic-%E2%80%93-pivoting-the-business-model/\\\">an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model</a>”, we’ll give this business model a try for awhile as we look for ways to freshen the stagnant world of educational technology.</p>\\n<h3>What’s coming next for Eduglu?</h3>\\n<p>Eduglu works well with 500-1000 members. But we want it to work for much much larger organizations. Organizations the size of my alma mater Brigham Young University that has 30,000 students and 250,000+ alumni. To make Eduglu work on that scale, we’ll be adding features such as group suggesting, robust search and filtering, activity streams, and twitter-style following.</p>\\n<p>Also we’re working on a number of social learning applications. Right now Eduglu ships with four social learning applications. A discussion/mailing list, wiki, and polling.</p>\\n<p>The next two major applications we’d like to ship are a blogging application that let’s learners blog on various things they are learning and comment on other’s blogs. If the learner has an existing blog, they’ll be able to connect it to their Eduglu blog so new posts there are automatically imported.</p>\\n<p>The second application is a Group RSS Reader that lets a group of learners subscribe to content via RSS and provides various means for rating, sorting, sharing, and discussing content brought into the group.</p>\\n<p>Both are powerful learning tools that help students more easily share what they are learning and track and discuss the best ideas that are being written about on the Internet and we’re excited to get them out into the wild.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2010-06-01---second-release-eduglu/index.md\n ** module id = 496\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"The problem of too general tools\",\"tags\":[\"entrepreneurship\"],\"date\":\"2010-06-02T19:49:23.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"readNext\":\"/how-design-social-networking-site-using-social-objects/\",\"body\":\"<p>There was a nugget of a comment today on the Lean Startup Circle from William Pietri:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>However, having made the mistake of building too-general tools before, let me offer a bit of advice. Tools may be general, but people only have specific problems. So if you want an individual to choose to use your software, you have to solve their specific problem well. Generality is a consequence of extracting the similar bits of specific problems, not a goal on its own (however much that appeals to gadget nerds and toolbuilders like us). Real users mainly appreciate that generality later, if they ever do, when they have a second specific problem that is now easier to solve because they’re familiar with your tool.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>It struck me because I’m slowly starting to see this is part of the problem I’m facing with my educational tool, <a href=\\\"http://eduglu.com\\\">Eduglu</a>. Right now I pitch Eduglu as a “social learning platform” that includes a number of learning tools out of the box and can easily be extended to meet specific needs of the learning organization that adopts it. But when I pitch, I don’t seem to be moving anyone. It seems my pitch is falling into the too-general tool trap that William warned against. Yes, an adopting organization can use it for all sorts of things, eventually, but people don’t buy things to solve “all sorts of things”. They buy things to meet very specific needs.</p>\\n<p>Or as Sean Murphy put it in another thread, narrower focus &amp; deeper pain is better.</p>\\n<p>The hardest part of starting a company I think is learning to understand how others think and feel about something. As a toolbuilder, I’m very used to evaluating generic tools and understanding how to apply them to solve my specific problems. But most people aren’t as adept at that art. I need to understand how to get inside people’s heads and intimately understand what they need and the learn to present what I’m building in a way that it will be obvious to them how my tool will solve their problems.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2010-06-02---problem-too-general-tools/index.md\n ** module id = 497\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Three worldwide education trends behind Eduglu\",\"tags\":[\"Education\",\"elearning2.0\",\"Learning\",\"Eduglu\",\"launchup\"],\"date\":\"2010-08-31T22:01:23.000Z\",\"draft\":true,\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Later this week, I’ll be presenting on my company <a href=\\\"http://eduglu.com\\\">Eduglu</a> and product <a href=\\\"http://eduglu.com/download-eduglu\\\">Eduglu</a> at <a href=\\\"http://www.launchup.org/2010/08/31/eduglu-qa/\\\">Launchup</a>, a local entrepreneurship event. In preparing for my presentation, I’ve stepped back again and revisited my reasons for why I started Eduglu and why I think it’s needed.</p>\\n<p>I see three trends which are starting to dramatically change how we learn and how that learning happens.</p>\\n<h3>The changing nature of learning</h3>\\n<p>Today’s educational system was designed when the expectation was that for most people, what they learned in school was sufficient to make them good employees for the remainder of their working career. If you started as an accountant in 1860 and retired 40 years later, at the end of your career you could expect that most of the knowledge you learned in school was still useful.</p>\\n<p>Today, that is very much not the case. Knowledge is growing exponentially and the “<a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life_of_knowledge\\\">half-life</a> <a href=\\\"http://www.elearnspace.org/Articles/connectivism.htm\\\">of knowledge</a>” has shrunken dramatically. Whereas 100 years ago, one large investment of schooling at the beginning of our lives was enough to last an entire career, now we need to getting smaller chunks of schooling throughout our lives. We’ll continually transition between investing in learning and harvesting the rewards of those learnings.</p>\\n<p>[Graph from “<a href=\\\"http://blog.trailmeme.com/2010/06/the-emerging-principles-of-lifelong-learning/\\\">The Emerging Principles of Lifelong Learning</a>” by <a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/vgr\\\">@vgr</a>]</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./lifelongLearning.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>An example of this I recently came across. I was talking to a client of mine about the industry they work in, <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_classification\\\">medical insurance coding.</a> Coding is the process of transforming a doctor’s description of a medical visit into universal medical code numbers. My client who provide a number of training courses on doing coding, were telling me about the coming change in United States from the international coding standard ICD9 to ICD-10. An enormous number of people involved with coding will need to receive new training to learn the new standards.</p>\\n<p>This is a great example of what is happening because of the shortened half-life of knowledge. Our knowledge is increasing rapidly about the human body and how to treat its problems. Because of this growth in knowledge, standards about how to describe diagnosis and procedures became outdated and were revised. Because of this coming shift to new coding standards, many people will need new training.</p>\\n<p>This same pattern is repeating across dozens of industries. Supporting this sorts of short semi-continuous online classes is a major focus for Eduglu.</p>\\n<h3>Higher Ed Bubble</h3>\\n<p>The current educational system is unsustainable and needs a pruning. It’s a bubble fueled by cheap federal student loans and is perilously similar to the housing bubble we recently lived through.</p>\\n<p>I ran across <a href=\\\"http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2010/06/higher-education-bubble-its-about-to.html#\\\">these two graphs</a> today which illustrate the problem well:</p>\\n<p><strong>Housing bubble</strong></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./housing-bubble.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p><strong>Higher Ed Bubble</strong></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"./highered-bubble.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\"></p>\\n<p>If <a href=\\\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columns/Sunday_Reflections/Higher-education_s-bubble-is-about-to-burst-95639354.html\\\">the bubble does pop</a> and students start to shy away from high priced colleges and look for cheaper alternatives, more and more will look towards the pioneering online schools who provide most of the value of traditional universities with far more flexibility and far less cost.</p>\\n<h3>Demand for higher education outgrowing ability to build new schools</h3>\\n<p>As the world becomes wealthier, 100s of millions of youth are beginning to demand access to higher education. In India alone, it was estimated that provide higher education to the same percentage the population as in United States, they would need to build nearly 2400 new universities in the next 25 years or roughly 2 per week.</p>\\n<p>Building that many schools is clearly impossible. Traditional face-to-face educational models can’t scale affordably to meet that sort of demand. New models need to be developed that can operate at the low costs and large scale required</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.col.org/resources/speeches/2007presentations/Pages/2007-massTertiaryEd.aspx\\\">http://www.col.org/resources/speeches/2007presentations/Pages/2007-massTertiaryEd.aspx</a></p>\\n<p>how to educate far more people for far less resources? 10x numbers of students for the same amount of resources?</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2010-08-31---three-worldwide-trends-behind-eduglu/index.md\n ** module id = 500\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"First beta release for Drupal-native mailinglist module\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"drupal planet\",\"Eduglu\",\"OG Mailinglist\"],\"date\":\"2010-09-15T22:49:54.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Today I rolled out the first beta for my <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/og_mailinglist\\\">Drupal module, OG Mailinglist</a>, which provides native mailinglist functionality to Drupal similar to <a href=\\\"http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/index.html\\\">Mailman</a> or <a href=\\\"http://groups.google.com\\\">Google Groups</a>.</p>\\n<p>OG Mailinglist provides complete email integration for Organic Group-based Drupal sites.

As part of developing the platform I’ve built a number of apps for it such as a forum/mailinglist, polls, etc.</p>\\n<p>But while these are nice apps and I’m really pleased about how the platform is coming together, I feel that Eduglu is still missing its set of killer apps.</p>\\n<p>Many people look at Eduglu now and think “meh”, “what does it do”, they ask, “that existing education / community platforms don’t already do?”</p>\\n<p>And… I can’t really answer that question. Not yet anyways. Eduglu is still missing its killer app that for 1000s of organizations will become <em>the</em> reason that they <em>must</em> adapt Eduglu as their learning platform. Something like email that for millions of companies and households was the “reason” they signed up for Internet.</p>\\n<p>So recently, I’ve made a prediction to myself, that Eduglu will become a success only if a large number of apps are built on top of the platform.</p>\\n<p>But luckily, I don’t have to rely entirely on people building apps specifically for Eduglu. In <a href=\\\"http://buytaert.net/\\\">Dries Buytaert’s</a> (founder of Drupal) <a href=\\\"http://buytaert.net/drupal-distributions\\\">first post on Drupal distributions</a> four years ago, he said that for Drupal distributions to succeed, they must collaborate not compete. That Drupal distros can’t fork Drupal core or otherwise introduce incompatibilities between themselves.</p>\\n<p>And happily, that is what has happened. Through the efforts of many in the Drupal community, particularly <a href=\\\"http://developmentseed.org/\\\">Development Seed</a>, it is possible to take an application written for one Drupal distro and reuse it across multiple other distros. And one very interesting effort, <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org/project/debut\\\">Debut</a>, is working to build a common set of applications specifically designed to serve as base applications for a variety of Drupal distrubutions.</p>\\n<p>So this has left me, Eduglu, and other Drupal distros in a nice spot. Many people are working together to build reusable apps and Drupal, particularly with the upcoming Drupal 7 release, has developed into a very nice framework for building web applications.</p>\\n<p>So I have two items now on my roadmap for Eduglu.</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Refine and evangelize the platform and</li>\\n<li>Develop killer apps.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>And while predicting in advance what is or isn’t a “killer app” is difficult, I have a few ideas up my sleeve. First on the list is a realtime notetaking app built with Drupal and <a href=\\\"http://etherpad.org\\\">Etherpad</a>. Students will be able to take notes together, attach audio recordings of the lecture and other media files, and save all of this to the class website where it’ll it can be referred to in the future.</p>\\n<p>And if you already know what you’re killer app for learning is and just need someone to build it then by all means, <a href=\\\"http://eduglu.com/contact\\\">please contact us!</a> We’d be happy to help :)</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2010-11-04---roadmaps-platforms-and-killer-apps/index.md\n ** module id = 509\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Creating a CCK Field module with an \\\"invisible\\\" widget\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"drupal planet\",\"etherpad\",\"drupal modules\"],\"date\":\"2010-11-19T00:14:48.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Most CCK Field modules have a widget where the user adds information upon creating a node which is then saved with the node.

Some tutorials I saw suggest you define your widget form in hook_elements/hook_process.

Generally you’ll just want to define your widget in hook_widgets.</p>\\n<p>Two really important things here to get your “invisible” widget to work correctly. First, you <strong>must</strong> name your form keys the same as you named your database column names in hook_field_settings. This tripped me up for a long time. CCK saves data by magic (you never explicitly save anything from a widget) and this is the key to getting the incantation to take. Second, using the &quot;<a href=\\\"http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer--topics--forms_api_reference.html/6#val\\\">value&quot; field type</a> was the key to creating an “invisible” field and getting my data saved correctly.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-php\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">&lt;?php</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">/**\\n * Implementation of hook_widget().\\n */</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">etherpad_widget</span><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">(&amp;$form, &amp;$form_state, $field, $items, $delta = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>)</span> </span>{\\n  $element[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'etherpad_url'</span>] = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">array</span>(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#type'</span> =&gt; <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'value'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#value'</span> =&gt; (<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">isset</span>($items[$delta][<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'etherpad_url'</span>]) &amp;&amp; !<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">empty</span>($form[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'nid'</span>][<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#value'</span>])) ? $items[$delta][<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'etherpad_url'</span>] : $field[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'etherpad_url'</span>] . etherpad_generate_padid($field[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'etherpad_url'</span>]),\\n  );\\n  $element[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'etherpad_text'</span>] = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">array</span>(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#type'</span> =&gt; <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'value'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#value'</span> =&gt; (<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">isset</span>($items[$delta][<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'etherpad_text'</span>]) &amp;&amp; !<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">empty</span>($form[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'nid'</span>][<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#value'</span>])) ? $items[$delta][<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'etherpad_text'</span>] : <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"default value for now until we have a function to generate one\\\"</span>,\\n  );\\n  $element[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'attributes'</span>] = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">array</span>(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#type'</span> =&gt; <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'value'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#value'</span> =&gt; (<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">isset</span>($items[$delta][<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'attributes'</span>]) &amp;&amp; !<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">empty</span>($form[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'nid'</span>][<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#value'</span>])) ? $items[$delta][<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'attributes'</span>] : serialize($field[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'attributes'</span>]),\\n  );\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// Used so that hook_field('validate') knows where to</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// flag an error in deeply nested forms.</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">empty</span>($form[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#parents'</span>])) {\\n    $form[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#parents'</span>] = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">array</span>();\\n  }\\n  $element[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'_error_element'</span>] = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">array</span>(\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#type'</span> =&gt; <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'value'</span>,\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#value'</span> =&gt; implode(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">']['</span>, array_merge($form[<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'#parents'</span>], <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">array</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'value'</span>))),\\n  );\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> $element;\\n}\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">?&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And that’s it!

It nicely describes what I’ve been doing a lot of lately.</p>\\n<p>The phrase comes from the newly released book by one of my favorite bloggers <a href=\\\"http://ribbonfarm.com\\\">Venkatesh Rao</a> – <a href=\\\"http://www.tempobook.com/\\\">Tempo: timing, tactics and strategy in narrative-driven decision-making</a> – which I’ve been cheerfully digesting over the past few weeks. The book is amazingly dense. It synthesizes a shelf full or two of books but I’m finding its ideas a fertile source for new ways to think about decision making and the world in general.</p>\\n<p>The opening page of the book re-introduced me to a quote from Fredrick Neitzsche:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Lonely one, you are going the way to yourself. And your way leads past yourself and your seven devils. You will be a heretic to yourself and a witch and soothsayer and fool and doubter and unholy one and a villain. You must wish to consume yourself in your own flame: how could you wish to become new unless you had first become ashes!</p>\\n<p>Lonely one, you are going the way of the creator: you would create a god for yourself out of your seven devils.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>One last thought, also drawn from Tempo, on the tension between contemplation and action. Quoting now, “a tension that causes us to swing between a greedy, grasping engagement of life, and a tentative, doubting withdrawal from it. A mode of life that doubts the possibility of meaning sufficiently to choose action, and believes in the possibility sufficiently to be tempted into reflection.”</p>\\n<p>As I’ve grown older, and hopefully a bit more mature, it seems more and more of my thinking has started to center around the many paradoxical pairs of ideas such as this one and others such as reason vs. emotion, freedom vs. order, individual integrity vs. com­munity responsibility, men vs. women, justice vs. mercy, liberty vs. equity, etc.</p>\\n<p>It seems one or more of these paradoxical pairs of ideas is at the heart of every significant problem I face.</p>\\n<p>The contemplation/action pair is especially meaningful right now as I’m in the midst of a doubting withdrawal from life as I close up shop on my first startup and reflect on what to do next.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2011-04-22---loose-assortment-thoughts/index.md\n ** module id = 514\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"New Drupal-Mixpanel integration module released to track event-based analytics\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"drupal planet\"],\"date\":\"2011-04-23T00:23:01.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>As part of my work with my (<a href=\\\"/eduglu-enters-deadpool\\\">now defunct</a>) startup Eduglu, I wrote a Drupal module that integrates with the popular analytics service Mixpanel.</p>\\n<p>Web analytics help you understand what visitors do on your website and what is working and what is not.

To fully have faith in the Lord, it’s not enough to believe in the Lord, we must actually understand what He will do in different situations.</p>\\n<p>This is why, I think, there’s such a strong connection between studying the gospel, personal revelation, and faith.

The less we understand about the Lord and His gospel the harder it is to have confidence in the Lord because we won’t know what He says He will do and when He does do something, we are completely befuddled as to why He did what He did.</p>\\n<p>So to me, confidence or faith in the Lord comes from knowing Him and understanding what He does and why He does what He does.</p>\\n<p>It’s like having a really good friend who you’ve known forever. You know each other so well that you know how they’ll act when they’re happy, sad, disappointed, hurt, etc. Whatever the situation, you can pretty well predict how they’ll act. And you’ve also learned you can rely on them to comfort you when sad, to listen to a story when something good happens happen, to give good council when you have a problem.</p>\\n<p>Developing faith in the Lord is much the same. As we get to know the Lord, understand His character, like that friend, we will soon be able to predict how the Lord will act given a certain situation. And the better we know the Lord, the better we will be able to predict what He will do and the more we can rely on Him. So in other words, understanding the Lord and having faith in the Lord is one and the same.</p>\\n<p>But for this to happen, we need to have personal experiences with the Lord. If a friend wants to introduce you to another friend and raves about how cool they are and how much you’ll like them, you’ll trust their opinion but only so much. You need to meet this new person yourself before you’ll fully believe that they are as cool as your friend says.</p>\\n<p>This is why I think that’s why scripture study and personal revelation are so important. Because without those things, we cannot understand God or why He does what He does. And without that understanding we cannot place full confidence in Him.</p>\\n<p>And not having that understanding can cause a lot of problems. I think a lot of the difficulties we face in life, particularly ones that challenge our faith, are the result of ignorance or misunderstandings about God.</p>\\n<p>For example, a trap I often fall into is I ask for blessings that the Lord doesn’t want to give me. I will pray with great sincerity for long periods of time and when the Lord finally convinces me the answer is no, I’m bitterly disappointed. If I’d understood better what the Lord wants to give me before I tried asking then I wouldn’t of been disappointed, or even surprised for that matter, when the Lord said no. I used to wander at how the <a href=\\\"http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/10?lang=eng#7\\\">Lord could promise certain prophets in the scriptures that whatever they asked for would be given them</a>. I don’t wander anymore because now it’s clear. The Lord could give them this power because He knew that these prophets understood Him and His plan so well that they would only ask for things He already intended to give them.</p>\\n<p>So all of us struggle at times with our faith in the Lord. How do we develop stronger faith in the Lord? I think the most straightforward answer to that question is simply, learn more about Him. Learn of His character. Learn of His promises. And learn about how and when He delivers on those promises.</p>\\n<p>Of course, doing this is easier said then done. I think this is the principle challenge of our life, learning about God and molding our lives after His.</p>\\n<p>I testify that the Lord cares very much that we understand Him correctly and He has given us many aids to learn of Him and He places experiences in our lives which, if we let them, will help us understand who He is and why He does what He does.</p>\\n<p>Now I want to share a few experiences where by learning more about the Lord, my faith was strengthened.</p>\\n<p>After spending the first part of my mission in the big city in Manila, I was transferred to a very rural farming area in Alfonso, Cavite, the province just south of Manila. After one transfer with my first companion there, I got a new companion and for the first time became a senior companion. And to be honest, I was kinda terrified. I didn’t have a lot of confidence yet in my Tagalog or in my abilities as a missionary but I really wanted to do a good job. And I was putting a lot of pressure on myself to measure up. Shortly after becoming a senior companion, I read a scripture which changed my mission and my life. It’s in <a href=\\\"http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6?lang=eng#33\\\">Doctrine and Covenants section 6 verse 34 and 36</a>. They read:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>34 Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are built upon my rock, they cannot prevail.</p>\\n<p>36 Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The effect of those scriptures on me was enormous. I realized much more clearly that I was on the Lord’s errand doing His will. And as long as I looked to the Lord in every thought and doubted not and feared not, He would guide, protect, and strengthen me enough to fulfill my duties as a missionary. After I read this, as we went around to our various appointments and some fear would come over me, I would repeat in my head over and over as a mantra of sorts, ‘‘look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not’’, and my fears would melt away.</p>\\n<p>My next experience was more recent. There was something I very much desired and wanted to pray to the Lord for His help in getting it. But for various reasons at the time I felt unworthy to ask, my imperfections and weaknesses seemed to be looming over me stronger than normal. About that time I read this from <a href=\\\"http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng\\\">Ether chapter 3 in the Book of Mormon</a>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>2 Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with thy servant because of his weakness before thee; for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are unworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures have become evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou has given us a commandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we many receive according to our desires.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>As the brother of Jared, I felt unworthy and somewhat evil at the time. But this scripture helped me realize that however unworthy I felt, I was compounding the problem by not praying for my desire. I realized that we don’t have to be perfect to be blessed by the Lord. I realized that no matter how unworthy or evil we think we are, the Lord still wants us to call on him. Because I understood this, my faith grew stronger that the Lord would bless me with the things I asked.</p>\\n<p>My last experience happened when I was suffering through a very difficult period of my life. There’s a story in the Book of Mormon I’ve always loved about the people led by Alma the Senior that broke away from King Noah and his people and established a new community. Soon however disaster struck and they were conquered and enslaved by a Lamenite army. I’ve always marveled at how well they stood up under this rather extreme trial. In <a href=\\\"http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24?lang=eng#14\\\">Mosiah 24:15</a> we read:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>15 And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and <em>they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.</em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I wandered how they were able to do that, ‘‘submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord’’ as I most certainly was not feeling the least bit cheerful and patient at the time. Were they some sort of super-spiritual humans that could perform great feats of self-control that I could never hope to?</p>\\n<p>But then the Spirit gently told me I was misreading the story. He directed my attention again to the <a href=\\\"http://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24?lang=eng#13\\\">previous verse</a>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>14 And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>It wasn’t that these people were so special (though they were) that they were able to bear this trial with cheerfulness and patience, it was because the Lord blessed them that their burdens became light. The Spirit also directed me to <a href=\\\"http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/30?lang=eng\\\">Doctrine and Covenants 30:1</a>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>1 Behold, I say unto you, David, that you have feared man and <em>have not relied on me for strength as you ought.</em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>I felt this chastisement also applied to me. I thought I had to endure the trouble I was facing by myself and was not relying on the Lord for strength as I ought. Humbled, I prayed that the Lord would strengthen me. From then on through the end of the experience, when the trouble threatened to overwhelm me, I would stop and pray, ‘‘Lord, I can’t do this by myself, please help me’’, and soon, I found that my burdens too became much easier to bear.</p>\\n<p>I testify that the Lord does exist. That He does love us. That He is merciful and kind and just. And that He can and will fulfill every promise He has made. And that as we learn of Him, learn of His will for us, and align our lives with His will, our confidence in Him will wax strong and we will be richly blessed all of our days.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2011-06-26---developing-faith-god/index.md\n ** module id = 521\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"It is the learners who inherit the future\",\"tags\":null,\"date\":\"2011-07-25T04:59:38.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<blockquote>\\n<p>The central task of education is to implant a will and a facility for\\nlearning; it should produce not learned but learning people.

I’ve tried a good chunk of the GTD apps out there and have been dissatisfied with each of them for one reason or another.</p>\\n<h2>Motivations</h2>\\n<p>I have a few reasons for starting this project.</p>\\n<p>First is I really like the GTD system. When it’s running well, I really do feel more organized and able to focus on my priorities. But I’ve never been able to find a system that was maintainable long-term. I’ve tried many that worked for a time but each gradually required more and more effort to maintain until eventually I had to quit using them. I’ve thought a fair bit about why they’ve failed and I believe I can create an app that will actually work long-term.</p>\\n<p>My second motivation is there’s a number of really cool technologies I’d like to learn or practice with including Node.js, Coffeescript, Backbone.js, ElasticSearch, Responsive Design, AppCache, and LocalStorage–each of which I’ll be using to build SimpleGTD. It’s really hard to learn new skills outside of the context of working toward a concrete goal so a nice compact project like this is gold.</p>\\n<p>My third motivation is to keep my startup “muscles” strong. For a variety of reasons, I’m not interested in doing another startup right now. But I will in the future. I plan to offer hosting and support for SimpleGTD app (for those not wanting to host it themselves). Doing the marketing, handling payments, support issues, etc. will allow me to practice all the parts of running a “real” company without the stress of caring whether my micro-business actually succeeds.</p>\\n<p>I have a number of similar side projects planned or in progress that I’ll also be treating as micro-businesses. I’m building these projects primarily for myself but it’ll be fun to also put them out in the wild and see what happens.</p>\\n<h2>Key design principles</h2>\\n<h3>Fast</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://thinkvitamin.com/web-apps/fred-wilsons-10-golden-principles-of-successful-web-apps/\\\">To quote Fred Wilson</a>, “Speed is more than a feature. Speed is the most important feature. If your application is slow, people won’t use it.”</p>\\n<p>More than any other flaw, lack of speed is the reason I eventually have quit the software GTD apps I’ve tried. Paper is really fast. Compared to a piece of paper or sticky note sitting on your desk, it’s cumbersome to have to load a desktop or web app just to view your tasks.</p>\\n<p>To compete with paper, any software-based GTD system must load instantly and quickly show you exactly what you want.</p>\\n<p>Other actions, such as navigating, adding, and editing projects and actions must also be fast. My plan is that all movement within the application can be done via the keyboard, ala GMail.</p>\\n<p>To meet my speed standards, I’m going to use a variety of techniques. First all code and data will be stored locally using AppCache and LocalStorage. The app will load first from LocalStorage and only then sync with the server. This should solve much of the slow-start problem.</p>\\n<p>Second, I’ll build the app as a single-page app. All communication with the server will happen asynchronously. This means viewing a project page or adding a new task won’t require reloading the page so navigation within the app will be fast.</p>\\n<h3>Simple</h3>\\n<p>A big problem I’ve had with other systems I’ve tried is they’re too complex for my tastes. They try too hard. I don’t want to implement <a href=\\\"http://www.dragosroua.com/staying-gtd-over-the-hype/\\\">every idea David Allen has ever come up with</a>. All I want my GTD app to do is add projects, add action items to these projects, and easily choose and sort the actions that I’ll be working on the next day or two.</p>\\n<p>Paper-like simplicity is my goal here, not Microsoft Project.</p>\\n<h3>Built for the 21st century</h3>\\n<p>This is the 21st century. Almost everyone now is carrying around a smartphone in their pocket 24/7. No one prints off todos anymore. You should be able to select your action items for the day on your computer, walk out the door, open the app on your phone and instantly see what needs to be done.</p>\\n<h2>Built to forgive and protect</h2>\\n<p>The above ideas are fairly standard. My last idea is a bit more unique.</p>\\n<p>Keeping task lists is a hard discipline and <a href=\\\"https://plus.google.com/114723964985237592593/posts/hsVEEpov6Ti\\\">almost everyone fails at times</a>. Our tasks lists seem to quickly disintegrate into a disorganized, unwieldy mess without the occasional superhuman effort to clean things up. I’d like SimpleGTD to help us avoid that superhuman effort.</p>\\n<p>I think this is one reason I like paper. When a list of tasks on paper gets too overwhelming, you can just throw it away or bury it under other paper. Most GTD/Task software is less forgiving in this respect. If you add a project or task it’s there forever until you explicitly delete it.</p>\\n<p>The problem is our brains has a selective membrane of sorts for commitments. It requires little force to insert a commitment but quite a bit of force to remove it. We’re addicted to being “productive” and the rewards that come from completing tasks. With each added task, we imagine the praise we’ll get once we accomplish it. Each new task is a shot of dopamine. Deleting a task or project kills the hope for that future reward.</p>\\n<p>In my past forays with GTD software, I would cheerful add tasks and projects much faster than I could finish them. They would accumulate and accumulate until I dreaded even looking at the software with its long list of uncompleted tasks.</p>\\n<p>What we have is a garbage collection problem. We accumulate projects and tasks don’t throw out the ones we’ve abandoned. The garbage piles up higher and higher until eventually we have to abandon the house altogether and start a new one.</p>\\n<p>Like people portrayed on the TV show <a href=\\\"http://www.aetv.com/hoarders/about/\\\">Hoarders</a>, we find it difficult to throw away commitments.</p>\\n<p>I think the weekly review is what’s supposed to corral this problem but I’ve never been able to do one consistently – most likely because I dread having to decide what projects/tasks to abandon.</p>\\n<p>So what we need is to have the software help us to delete projects/tasks that we can’t accomplish. As I’ve proven many-a-time, I can’t manually keep my tasks lists in check. What we need I think is a Roomba-like garbage collector that detects dying projects and cleans them up for us.</p>\\n<p>But how to detect those projects/tasks that have gone stale–those projects/tasks that we’ve effectively abandoned but haven’t yet told our consciousness? How can the software pick up on our unconscious cues that a task or project should be removed?</p>\\n<p>The best way I’ve thought of so far is to track how often we look at something. If we’re actually working on a project or task, we’ll be viewing or editing it fairly often. When we start to abandon a project or task, we stop looking at it. The software will track each time a project or task is viewed. If enough time passes since the last time you viewed the project, it’ll be garbage collected and removed from active view. For tasks, they’ll be removed from the active task list. For projects, they’ll be moved to the someday/maybe list. And for projects already in the someday/maybe list, eventually they’ll be moved into an archived list.</p>\\n<p>On timing, my thinking is tasks get garbage collected after 24 hours, projects after two months, and someday/maybe projects after six months.</p>\\n<p>So if you want a task or project to disappear, just ignore it and it’ll eventually go away. Which follows our natural pattern. If we don’t want to do something, we stop thinking about and eventually forget it. Most software has the annoying property of never forgetting.</p>\\n<p>At the start of the week, your active todos list should be white and empty, waiting for you to select the weeks tasks. If you load up a number of tasks at the beginning of the week but an emergency comes up, those tasks will silently disappear letting you focus on the emergency. If you’re heavily focused for a few months on a couple projects at work, all our other projects will kindly hide themselves in someday/maybe. If we abandon the GTD-ship in despair, when we come back, all our projects will be waiting in storage and easily reactivated.</p>\\n<h2>Moving forward</h2>\\n<p>I’m really excited about my plans. It should be a fun project technically and is software I could really use right now.</p>\\n<h3>How you can get involved</h3>\\n<p>I’d appreciate feedback on my ideas. If you’ve tried and failed with GTD in the past, why did you fail? How did the system you used (software or otherwise) help/hinder you? Did my analysis, that failure comes from an overload of low-priority projects/tasks, resonate with you? Am I missing anything obvious here?</p>\\n<p>Once I get a usable prototype built, I’d love beta testers. Please contact me if you’re interested in getting early access.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2011-10-07---simplegtd/index.md\n ** module id = 523\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Chatroom Feature for Drupal 6.x built with Node.js and Backbone.js\",\"tags\":[\"drupal\",\"drupal planet\",\"backbone.js\",\"node.js\",\"experiments\"],\"date\":\"2011-10-12T19:47:34.000Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"body\":\"<p>Recently, for fun and learning, I built a group chatroom feature for Drupal 6.x.

There are a few obscure bugs left but by and large, it’s plenty stable for those wanting a chatroom on Drupal 6.x.</p>\\n<p>The feature should work with any site using Spaces and Organic Groups. The demo site I setup, for example, is using a default installation of <a href=\\\"http://openatrium.com/\\\">Open Atrium.</a></p>\\n<h2>Technology stack</h2>\\n<p>The chatroom is built using a now fairly standard set of technologies.

I used <a href=\\\"http://socket.io\\\">Socket.io</a> for sending the chat messages between clients and the server.

But as I no longer do Drupal\\ndevelopment, maintaining (and even using) Drupal feels like more and more of a burden.\\nSo like the other <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/paulg/status/402205795552489472\\\">cool kids on the internet</a>\\nI decided to convert my site to a static website. Easy to host, zero security updates, and completely customizable.</p>\\n<p>I evaluated quite a few of the <a href=\\\"http://staticgen.com/\\\">popular static site frameworks</a> out there e.g.\\n<a href=\\\"http://jekyllrb.com/\\\">Jekyll</a> and <a href=\\\"http://docpad.org/\\\">Docpad</a> but none of them\\nreally attracted me. It seemed the problem of generating an HTML site was small enough\\nthat with <a href=\\\"http://gulpjs.com\\\">GulpJS</a>, a number of <a href=\\\"https://github.com/KyleAMathews/blog/blob/master/package.json\\\">NPM modules</a>,\\nand some glue code I could easily build my own static site generator.</p>\\n<p>And as hoped, building a custom static site generator turned out to be straightforward.\\nProps to GulpJS and the vast treasure-trove of Node.js modules in the <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.org/\\\">NPM repository</a>.\\nYou can see the meat of the logic for generating this site <a href=\\\"https://github.com/KyleAMathews/blog/blob/master/gulpfile.coffee#L23-L78\\\">at the blog’s repo</a>.</p>\\n<p>The next task was how to host the site. I briefly considered using Amazon S3, which is\\na very attractive option as it’s very fast and essentially infinitely scalable, but decided against\\nit as I wanted a chance to play around with two other software tools, <a href=\\\"http://docker.io\\\">Docker</a> and <a href=\\\"http://nginx.org/\\\">Nginx</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Building applications with Docker</h2>\\n<p>Docker has really captured my and many other developers’ imaginations. Its primary\\nattraction to me is the utter simplicity it enables in packaging and deploying server applications.\\nComing from years of writing complicated <a href=\\\"http://www.getchef.com/\\\">Chef</a> or <a href=\\\"http://www.ansible.com/home\\\">Ansible</a>\\nscripts, being able to bundle each applications’ dependencies together is a breath of\\nfresh air. <a href=\\\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GlobalVariablesAreBad\\\">Global variables (and packages) are bad</a>.\\nDocker lets you completely ignore the “global state” of the server that’s running\\nyour application. It’s truly a “Write once, run anywhere” system. If it works on\\nyour laptop, it’ll work in production no matter where or what it’s installed with.</p>\\n<p>This changes how you think about the boundaries of your application.\\nConsider my case of hosting this static website. Typically you’d think of this blog\\nas the collection of HTML, CSS, and images that make up the site.</p>\\n<p>What you think your application is affects how you deploy it. If your application is a bundle of files then\\n&quot;deploying&quot; means placing these files inside a software system that understands HTTP and can serve files, e.g. Apache or Nginx.</p>\\n<p>Compare this to how I’m using Docker for this blog. Instead of using a global Nginx instance\\nto serve my blog, I create a Docker image with Nginx <em>and</em> my blog’s files. Which makes the resulting &quot;blog application&quot;\\nan atomic unit that I can build, test, and run anywhere as many times as I want.</p>\\n<p>This is a much more preferable outcome. Instead of a messy collection of files as my outcome,\\nwith Docker, I have a neat tidy Docker image. Now to to run a very high-performance blog, all I\\nneed to do is type <code>docker run blog</code> and off it goes.</p>\\n<p>This makes some fun and useful things quite easy. E.g. while writing this post, I was curious how well\\nmy blog would hold up under load testing. I didn’t want to use the container running the live\\nversion of this blog for the testing as that would fill my access logs with useless entries.\\nSo instead, I ran an additional instance of my Docker blog image on the\\nsame server but listening on a different port. I used this twin\\nversion of my blog to do the load testing and threw it away once the testing was finished. Setting up\\na parallel version of this blog would be much more difficult with a global installation of Nginx.</p>\\n<h2>Docker layers</h2>\\n<p>Docker has an additional innovation which I love. Docker lets you create base images\\nwhich your application can build on. Since all static sites need about the same Nginx configuration,\\nI created a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/KyleAMathews/docker-nginx\\\">Nginx Docker image</a>\\nI can use (and anyone else) as a base whenever building a new static website.</p>\\n<p>By encapsulating the Nginx configuration in an image, the Dockerfile (Docker’s DSL\\nfor defining image builds) <a href=\\\"https://github.com/KyleAMathews/blog/blob/master/Dockerfile\\\">for this blog</a> is incredibly simple. Three lines in fact.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">FROM kyma/docker-nginx\\nADD public/ /var/www\\nCMD <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'nginx'</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The first line tells Docker to use my Nginx image as the base, the second says to add\\nthe site’s files within the image at /var/www, and the third says to run Nginx when\\na new container is started.</p>\\n<p>There’s tons of similar base images available on the public Docker image index for building <a href=\\\"https://index.docker.io/search?q=ruby\\\">Ruby</a>,\\n<a href=\\\"https://index.docker.io/search?q=python\\\">Python</a>, <a href=\\\"https://index.docker.io/search?q=go\\\">Go</a>, etc. applications.\\nBut it’s also trivial to create base images for your specific needs. For example, this is\\na <a href=\\\"https://github.com/KyleAMathews/docker-nodejs-base/blob/master/Dockerfile\\\">base image I wrote with the tools I commonly use to build web frontends</a>.\\nI’ve used it now for several side projects of mine.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./2014-04-18---hosting-static-sites-with-docker-and-nginx/index.md\n ** module id = 528\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = {\"title\":\"Tools to help administer your Facebook Groups\",\"date\":\"2014-05-20T23:46:37.121Z\",\"layout\":\"post\",\"readNext\":\"/building-your-own-tools/\",\"body\":\"<p>I’m an administrator for an active Facebook group.
